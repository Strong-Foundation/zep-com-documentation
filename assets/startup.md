## **Step 2: Leverage the Archive to Create Safe, Effective, and Compliant Products**

The SDS (Safety Data Sheets) and Ingredient Disclosure Pages in this archive contain crucial information that will help you formulate products that are safe, effective, and compliant with industry standards.

### How to Use the Archive:

1. **Ingredient Research:**

   - Browse the Ingredient Disclosure Pages to see the chemical components in Zep products. Understand the role each ingredient plays in cleaning and identify which ingredients align with your business goals (e.g., eco-friendliness, non-toxicity).
   - Avoid using harmful chemicals, opting for safer and environmentally friendly alternatives where possible.

2. **Formulation:**

   - Utilize the information from the SDS documents to guide the safe formulation of your products. For example, if you’re creating a cleaner, refer to the SDS to understand the correct handling, safety precautions, and recommended usage.
   - Ensure that you have a well-documented process for each product, including ingredient sourcing, mixing, testing, and packaging.

3. **Compliance and Safety:**

   - Follow the safety guidelines detailed in the SDS. These documents also provide regulatory information to help you meet legal and compliance standards for labeling and handling.
   - Make sure to create your own SDS documents for every product you sell or service you provide, based on your formulations and ingredients.

4. **Customization:**
   - As you analyze various products, look for opportunities to customize or innovate — whether that’s creating eco-friendly alternatives, scent-free formulations, or specialized cleaners for a specific industry (e.g., medical facilities or foodservice).
