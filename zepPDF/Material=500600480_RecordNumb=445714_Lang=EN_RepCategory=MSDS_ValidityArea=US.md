ommended exposure limit.  At this time, the other constituents have no known exposure limits. 
 
Engineering measures 
: 
Use of adequate ventilation should be sufficient to control 
worker exposure to airborne contaminants. If the use of this 
product generates dust, fumes, gas, vapor or mist, use pro-
cess enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineer-
ing controls to keep worker exposure below any recommend-
ed or statutory limits. 
The engineering controls also need to keep gas, vapor or 
dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. 
Personal protective equipment 
Respiratory protection 
 
: 
Use a properly fitted NIOSH approved air-purifying or air-fed 
respirator complying with an approved standard if a risk as-
sessment indicates this is necessary. 
 
The filter class for the respirator must be suitable for the max-
imum expected contaminant concentration 
(gas/vapor/aerosol/particulates) that may arise when han-
dling the product. If this concentration is exceeded, self-
contained breathing apparatus must be used. 
 
Hand protection 
 
: 
Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an 
approved standard should be worn at all times when handling 
chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is nec-
essary. 
 
Eye protection 
 
: 
Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should 
be used when a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. 
 
Skin and body protection 
: 
Choose body protection in relation to its type, to the concen-

Animal Toxicity: 
Rat, oral, duration 2 year 
Effect: no tumors 
 
Mouse, oral, duration 2 years 
Effect: no tumors 
Mouse, dermal, duration 18 months 
Effect: no skin tumors 
Rat, inhalation, duration 2 years 
Target organ: lungs 
Effect: inflammation, fibrosis, tumors 
Note: Tumors in the rat lung are considered to be related to 
the "particle overload phenomenon" rather than to a specific 
chemical effect of carbon black itself in the lung.  These ef-
fects in rats have been reported in many studies on other 
poorly soluble inorganic particles and appear to be rat specif-
ic. Tumors have not been observed in other species (i.e., 
mouse and hamster) for carbon black or other poorly soluble 
particles under similar circumstances and study conditions. 
Mortality studies (human data): A study on carbon black pro-
duction workers in the UK (Sorahan, 2001) found an in-
creased risk of lung cancer in two of the five plant studied; 
however, the increase was not related to the dose of carbon 
black. Thus, the authors did not consider the increased risk in 
lung cancer to be due to carbon black exposure.  A German 
study of carbon black workers at one plant (Morfeld, 2006; 
Buechte, 2006) found a similar increase in lung cancer risk 
but, like the Sorohan, 2001 (UK study) found no association 
with carbon black exposure.  A large US study of 18 plants 
showed a reduction in lung cancer risk in carbon black pro-
duction workers (DEll, 2006). Based upon these studies, the 
February 2006 Working Group at the International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that the human evi-
dence for carcinogenicity was inadequate (IARC, 2010). 
Since the IARC evaluation of carbon black, Sorahan and Har-

rington (2007) have re-analyzed the UK study data using an 
alternative exposure hypothesis and found a positive associa-
tion with carbon black exposure in two of the five plants. The 
same exposure hypothesis was applied by Morfeld and 
McCunney (2009) to the German cohort; in contrast, they 
found no association between carbon black exposure and 
lung cancer risk and, thus, no support for the alternative expo-
sure hypothesis used by Sorahan and Harrington. 
Overall, as a result of these detailed investigations, no causa-
tive link between carbon black exposure and cancer risk in 
humans has been demonstrated. 
IARC CANCER CLASSIFICATION: In 2006 IARC re-affirmed 
its 1995 finding that there is "inadequate evidence" from hu-
man health studies to assess whether carbon black causes 
cancer in humans. IARC concluded that there is "sufficient 
evidence" in experimental animal studies for the carcinogen-
icity of carbon black. IARC's overall evaluation is that carbon 
black is "possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B)". This 
conclusion was based on IARC's guidelines, which generally 
require such a classification if one species exhibits carcino-
genicity in two or more animal studies (IARC, 2010). 
 
Solvent extracts of carbon black were used in one study of 
rats in which skin tumors were found after dermal application 
and several studies of mice in which sarcomas were found 
following subcutaneous injection. IARC concluded that there 
was "sufficient evidence" that carbon black extracts can cause 
cancer in animals (Group 2B). 
ICGIH CANCER CLASSIFICATION: Confirmed Animal Car-
cinogen with Unknown Relevance to Humans (Category A3 
Carcinogen). 
 
ASSESSMENT: Applying the guidelines of self-classification 
under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and 
Labeling of Chemicals, carbon black is not classified as a 
carcinogen.  Lung tumors are induced in rats as a result of 
repeated exposure to inert, poorly soluble particles like carbon 
black and other poorly soluble particles. Rats tumors are a 
result of a secondary non-genotoxic mechanism that has 
questionable relevance for classification in humans. In support 
of this opinion, the CLP Guidance for Specific Target Organ 
Toxicity - Repeated Exposure (STOT-RE), cites lung overload 
under mechanisms not relevant to humans. Human health 
studies show that exposure to carbon black does not increase 
the risk to carcinogenicity.
