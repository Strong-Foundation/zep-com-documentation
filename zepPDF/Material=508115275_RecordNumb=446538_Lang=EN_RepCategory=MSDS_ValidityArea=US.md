SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES
Description of First-Aid Measures
General
If exposed or concerned seek medical advice/attention.
Eye Contact
Immediately flush with clear water for at least 15 minutes, including under the eyelids. Consult a doctor.
Skin Contact
Remove with soap and water, rinsing and repeating for 15 minutes.  Use skin cream to counter any resulting dryness.
Consult a physician if irritation continues. If large skin area is affected, remove contaminated clothing.
Ingestion
Do not induce vomiting! Immediately have the victim drink plenty of water. Do not give milk or digestible oils.  Keep airways
free.  Contact a physician.  Never give anything by mouth if victim is rapidly losing consciousness, unconscious, or convulsing.
Inhalation
Remove to fresh air.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration.  If breathing is difficult, give oxygen.  Seek medical attention
if symptoms persist or if unconscious.
First-Aid Responder
                    Protection
Wear adequate personal protective equipment based on the nature and severity of the emergency.
Most Important Symptoms and Effects, Both Acute and Delayed
Eye Contact
Liquid contact may cause pain along with moderate eye irritation.
Skin Contact
Prolonged or repeated exposure may cause skin irritation.  Repeated contact may cause drying or flaking of skin.  May cause
more severe response if confined to skin. 
Ingestion
Due to being an aerosol, the product does not lend itself to ingestion.  Should ingestion occur, it may cause irritation to
membranes of the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract resulting in vomiting and/or cramps.  Aspiration of vomit into
the lungs may cause inflammation, and possible chemical pneumonitis, bronchopneumonia, or pulmonary edema. 
Inhalation
Prolonged or repeated overexposure is anesthetic.  May cause irritation of the respiratory tract, or acute nervous system
depression characterized by headache, dizziness, staggering gait, confusion or death.  Irritation of the mucous membranes,
coughing, and dyspnea are also possible.

Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical or Mixture
Decomposition Products
Oxides of carbon (CO, CO2), smoke, and/or vapors
Hazards from the Product
CONTENTS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND UNDER PRESSURE.  In a fire or if heated, a pressure increase will occur which may
result in the container bursting.  Vapours heavier than air may spread along the ground and travel to an ignition source.  
Advice for Firefighters
Protective Actions
Use water spray to cool fire exposed containers as contents may rupture violently from heat developed pressure.
Protective Equipment
As with any fire wear SCBA pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH approved, and full protective gear.
SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures
For Non-Emergency
                    Personnel
No action should be taken by non-emergency personnel without suitable training.  Evacuate surrounding areas.  Keep
unnecessary and unprotected personnel from entering.  Do not touch or walk through spill.  Remove ignition sources and
provide adequate ventilation only if it is safe to do so.
For Emergency Responders
Use personal protection as recommended in Section 8.  Observe precautions provided for non-emergency personnel.
Environmental Precautions
Precautions
Keep out of drains, sewers, ditches, and waterways.  Minimize use of water to prevent environmental contamination.
Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up
Containment Procedures
Product is an aerosol, therefore spills and leaks are unlikely.  In case of rupture, released content may be contained with
oil/solvent absorbent pads, socks, and/or absorbents.  DO NOT use combustible material such as sawdust.
Cleanup Procedures
Spills from aerosol cans are unlikely and are generally of small volume.  Large spills are therefore not normally considered a
problem.  In case of actual rupture, avoid breathing vapors and ventilate area well.  Remove sources of ignition and use
non-sparking equipment.  Soak up material with inert absorbent and place in safety containers for proper disposal.
Other Information
Aerosol products represent a limited hazard and will not spill or leak unless ruptured.  In case of rupture contents are
generally evacuated from the can rapidly.  Area should be ventilated immediately and continuous ventilation provided until
all fumes and vapors have been removed.  Aerosol cans should never be incinerated or burned.  See Section 13 for disposal.
Prohibited Materials
Combustible absorbent material such as sawdust, use of equipment that may cause sparking.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
Precautions for Safe Handling
General Handling
                    Precautions
KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.  Avoid prolonged or repeated skin contact.  Avoid breathing of vapors.  Do not
incinerate (burn) containers.  Always replace overcap when not in use.  Avoid use around open flames or other sources of
ignition.  Exposure to heat or prolonged exposure to sun may cause can to burst.  Use only with adequate ventilation,
opening doors or windows to achieve cross-ventilation.  Wash hands after use.

Hygiene Recommendations
Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product.  Wash hands thoroughly after use.  Remove contaminated clothing and
protective equipment before entering eating or smoking areas.
Conditions for Safe Storage Including Any Incompatibilities
Storage Requirements
Storage of individual cans should be done in an area below 50 °C (122 °F), and away from heat sources.  Ensure can is in a
secure place to prevent knocking over and accidental rupture.  For storage of pallet quantities, compliance with NFPA 30B
(Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products) is recommended.  This product is classified as a Level 3 Aerosol.
Incompatibilities
Segregate storage away from materials indicated in Section 10

Appropriate Engineering Control
Engineering Measures
Use only with adequate ventilation.  General ventilation (typically 10 air changes per hour) should be used.  Ventilation rates
should be matched to conditions.  Local exhaust ventilation or an enclosed handling system may be necessary to control air
contamination below that of the lowest OEL from the table above.
Individual Protection Measures
Hygiene Considerations
Avoid breathing vapors and contact with the skin and eyes.  Always replace overcap when not in use.  Keep out the reach of
children.  Wash hands after use.
Thermal Protection
This product does not present a thermal hazard.
Respiratory Protection
An approved respirator with organic vapor cartridge may be permissible under certain circumstances where airborne
concentrations are expected to exceed occupational exposure limits. If respirators are needed, compliance with OSHA
standard 29 CFR 1910.134 is necessary.  
Skin Protection
For brief contact, no precautions other than clean body-covering clothing should be needed.  When prolonged or repeated
contact could occur, use protective clothing impervious to the ingredients listed in Section 2.
Eye/Face Protection
Safety glasses with side shields are recommended as a minimum for any type of industrial chemical handling. Where eye
contact with this material could occur, chemical splash proof goggles are recommended.   
Other Protective Equipment
Safety showers and eye-wash stations should be available in the workplace near where the material will be used.

inhaling this product may be harmful or fatal.  Reports of chronic poisoning from Toluene describe anemia, decreased blood
cell count and bone marrow hypoplasia. Liver and kidney damage may occur. Exposure may affect a developing fetus. N-
Hexane is toxic to the peripheral nerves, characterized by numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities, progressively
worsening of neuromuscular motor coordination (polyneuritis or polyneuropathy), and even partial paralysis.
Medical Conditions
                    Aggravated

SECTION 13 - DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS
Waste Disposal
Characteristics and waste stream classification can change with product use and location.  It is the responsibility of the user
to determine the proper storage, transportation, treatment, and/or disposal methodologies for spent materials and residues
at the time of disposition.  All waste must be disposed of in compliance with the respective national, federal, state, and/or
local regulations. 
Waste Disposal of Packaging
An aerosol container that does not contain a significant amount of liquid would meet the definition of scrap metal (40 CFR
261.1(c)(6)), and would be exempt from RCRA regulation under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(iv) if it is to be recycled.  If containers are
to be disposed of (not recycled) it must be managed under all applicable RCRA and state regulations.
