If the specific chemical identity and/or the exact percentage of an ingredient are not specified, the 
information has been withheld as a trade secret. 
 
SECTION 4: FIRST-AID MEASURES 
 
In case of skin contact; remove and launder contaminated clothing and shoes immediately.  Wash affected 
area with soap and water. 
 
In case of eye contact; rinse thoroughly with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes and consult a 
physician. 
 
If swallowed; do not induce vomiting.  Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.  Rinse 
mouth with water. Consult a physician. 
 
Chlorine dioxide vapors are emitted when this product contacts acids or chlorine.  If these vapors are 
inhaled move person into fresh air.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration.  Consult a physician.  
Monitor patient closely for delayed development of pulmonary edema which may occur up to 48-72 hours 
post inhalation. 
 
SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Substance does not burn but supports the combustion of flammable substances through the liberation of 
oxygen.  Water is the preferred extinguishing media when it is compatible with the burning substance.   If 
water is not compatible, use dry powder extinguisher.  
 
Burning will release hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) and oxides of sodium (NaOx ). 
 
Firefighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) if necessary.   
 
SECTION 6:  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
SPILL CONTAINMENT: 
 
Avoid allowing spilled material to dry to crystalline sodium chlorite.  Dry sodium chlorite is a strong 
oxidizer and creates a potential fire hazard when in contact with combustible materials.  Use a non-
combustible absorbent such as sand or vermiculite to absorb spilled or leaked Keeper Professional Poultry 
before it dries.  Remove any powder residue from dried Keeper Professional Poultry by rinsing with water.  
Absorb rinse water with sand or other non-combustible absorbent and discard.  Do not discharge this

product to storm drains or to any surface or groundwater source unless specifically allowed under a valid 
NPDES permit.  
 
SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
HANDLING: 
 
Use product only as directed by the label.  Avoid contact with skin and eyes; avoid breathing any vapors 
or fumes resulting from product activation. Wash thoroughly after handling.  Thoroughly rinse all 
protective gear and handling equipment, such as transfer pumps and lines, with water prior to reuse or 
storage.  Keep away from children, animals, and unauthorized personnel. 
 
PRODUCT STORAGE: 
 
Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated location away from acids, chlorine and chlorine compounds, 
hypochlorite 
(bleach), 
organic 
solvents, 
sulfur 
and 
sulfite 
compounds, 
phosphorus, 
combustible/flammable materials, and direct sunlight.  Keep containers tightly closed when not in use and 
open carefully to prevent spillage.  Storage on wooden floors and pallets is not recommended. Do not 
contaminate water, food or feed by storage or disposal. 
 
SECTION 8:  EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
 
No Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) or American 
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit values (TLV) have been 
established for this product. 
 
Wear splash proof goggles to protect the eyes.  Use gloves and protective clothing to protect against skin 
contact.  Remove contaminated clothing immediately and laundry before reuse. 
 
 
Use directions for this product typically require its activation by mixing with GRAS (generally regarded as 
safe) acids.  The reaction leads to formation of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas. Chlorine dioxide vapor 
from activated solutions may cause respiratory irritation.  Severe overexposure may cause lung damage.  
Chlorine dioxide has a PEL of 0.1 ppm and a STEL of 0.3 ppm. Activate and use only in well-ventilated 
areas.  For applications where activated product is used in an enclosed area or which involve potential 
employee exposure, such as in a fogging or spraying application, respiratory protection is required. 
 
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: 
 
In accordance with OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1910.134 and 29 CFR 1910.1000) use a NIOSH approved air 
purifying respirators (APR) with cartridges approved for chlorine dioxide (ClO2).
