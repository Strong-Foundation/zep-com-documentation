Section 11: Toxicological Information 
 
 
TOXICITY TESTING – ACUTE Inhalation – Studies with Wistar Albino rats exposed to a respirable aerosol made from a solution of 
Vital Oxide at a level of 2.08 mg/l for four hours resulted in no deaths and no abnormal necropsy observations. Eye Contact – Studies 
with New Zealand white rabbits showed this product is a very mild ocular irritant; mild conjunctival irritation was observed, but cleared 
within 24 hours. Skin Contact – Study of dermal toxicity in New Zealand white rabbits showed the product to be non- toxic: Dermal 
LD50> 5,000 mg/kg of body weight; Study of dermal irritation in New Zealand white rabbits showed the product is not a dermal irritant. In 
Dermal Sensitization studies, Vital Oxide was determined not to be a sensitizer. Swallowing - Acute oral toxicity in albino rats: Non-
toxic LD50>5,000 mg/kg of body weight.
