Suitable extinguishing 
media: 
Use fire-extinguishing media appropriate for surrounding materials.  
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media: 
Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire.  
 
Specific hazards arising from 
the chemical: 
Vapors may travel considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash 
back.  
 
Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters 
 
Special fire fighting 
procedures: 
No data available. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for fire-fighters: 
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame 
retardant coat, helmet with face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in 
enclosed spaces, SCBA.  
 
6. Accidental release measures 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures: 
Ventilate closed spaces before entering them. ELIMINATE all ignition 
sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area). Keep 
upwind.  
 
Methods and material for 
containment and cleaning 
up: 
Absorb spill with vermiculite or other inert material, then place in a container 
for chemical waste.  
 
Notification Procedures: 
Prevent entry into waterways, sewer, basements or confined areas. Stop 
the flow of material, if this is without risk. ELIMINATE all ignition sources 
(no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area). Stop leak if you 
can do so without risk.  
 
Environmental Precautions: 
Do not contaminate water sources or sewer. Prevent further leakage or 
spillage if safe to do so. Avoid release to the environment.  
 
7. Handling and storage 
 
Precautions for safe handling: 
Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Keep away from heat, hot surfaces, 
sparks, open flames and other ignition sources. No smoking. Do not spray 
on an open flame or other ignition source. Do not pierce or burn, even after 
use.  
 
Conditions for safe storage, 
including any 
incompatibilities: 
Pressurized container: protect from sunlight and do not expose to 
temperatures exceeding 50°C. Do not pierce or burn, even after use.

Individual protection measures, such as personal protective equipment 
 
General information: 
Good general ventilation (typically 10 air changes per hour) should be used. 
Ventilation rates should be matched to conditions. Supplementary local 
exhaust ventilation, closed systems, or respiratory and eye protection may 
be needed in special circumstances, such as poorly ventilated spaces, 
heating, evaporation of liquids from large surfaces, spraying of mists, 
mechanical generation of dusts, drying of solids, etc.  
 
Eye/face protection: 
Wear safety glasses with side shields (or goggles).  
 
Skin Protection 
Hand Protection: 
No data available. 
 
Other: 
Wear suitable protective clothing.  
 
Respiratory Protection: 
In case of inadequate ventilation use suitable respirator. Seek advice from 
local supervisor.  
 
Hygiene measures: 
Observe good industrial hygiene practices. When using do not smoke.
