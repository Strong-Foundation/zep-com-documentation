EMERGENCY OVERVIEW
Precautionary Statements - Prevention
Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood. Use personal
protective equipment as required. Do not taste or swallow. Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. Wash face, hands and
any exposed skin thoroughly after handling.
Response:  Immediately call a poison center or physician.
IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
IF ON SKIN (or hair): Remove immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with water. Wash contaminated clothing before
reuse.
IF INHALED: Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing.
IF SWALLOWED: Rinse mouth. DO NOT induce vomiting.
Storage:
Store locked up.
Disposal:
Dispose of contents/container to an approved waste disposal plant.
DANGER

all contaminated clothing and shoes. Excess acid on skin can be neutralized with a 2%
solution of sodium bicarbonate in water. Consult a physician.
Inhalation
Remove to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If not breathing, give artificial
respiration and contact emergency personnel.
Ingestion
Do NOT induce vomiting. Drink plenty of water. Clean mouth with water. Call a physician
immediately. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.
Self-protection of the first aider 
Use personal protective equipment. See section 8 for more information. Do not use
mouth-to-mouth method if victim ingested or inhaled the substance; give artificial respiration
with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper respiratory
medical device.
5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES
Suitable extinguishing media
Dry chemical or CO 2. DO NOT USE WATER.
Specific hazards arising from the chemical
Contact with most metals causes the formation of explosive and flammable hydrogen gas. React vigorously with water.
Protective equipment and precautions for firefighters
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent) and full
protective gear.
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures  
Personal precautions
Ensure adequate ventilation. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and inhalation of vapors. Use
personal protective equipment. See section 8.
Environmental precautions
See Section 12 for additional Ecological Information. Beware of vapors accumulating to
form explosive concentrations. Vapors can accumulate in low areas.
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up  
Methods for containment
Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth,
diatomaceous earth, vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to local /
national regulations (see Section 13).
Methods for cleaning up
Neutralize spill with alkaline material (sodium bicarbonate), being careful to prevent
splattering, then containerize slurry and hold for later disposal. If local regulations permit,
dilute slurry with water and rinse to drain with excess water. After cleaning, flush away
traces with water.
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
Precautions for safe handling
Handling
Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice. Prevent contact with
skin, eyes, and clothing. Do not taste or swallow. Do not eat, drink, or smoke when using
this product.
Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
Storage:
Keep containers tightly closed in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. Keep away from
