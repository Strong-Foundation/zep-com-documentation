SECTION 4: First aid measures 
 
Eye Contact:  If irritation or redness develops from exposure, flush eyes with clean water. If symptoms persist, seek medical 
attention.  
Skin Contact:  Immediately flush affected area(s) with large amounts of water while removing contaminated shoes, clothing, and 
constrictive jewelry. If skin surface is damaged, apply a clean dressing and seek immediate medical attention. If skin surface is not 
damaged, cleanse the affected area(s) thoroughly by washing with mild soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner. If irritation or 
redness develops, seek immediate medical attention. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.  
Inhalation:  First aid is not normally required. If breathing difficulties develop, move victim away from source of exposure and into 
fresh air in a position comfortable for breathing. Seek immediate medical attention.  
Ingestion:  First aid is not normally required; however, if swallowed and symptoms develop, seek medical attention.  
Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed:  Inhalation of oil mists or vapors generated at elevated 
temperatures may cause respiratory irritation.  Accidental ingestion can result in minor irritation of the digestive tract, nausea and 
diarrhea. Prolonged or repeated contact may dry skin and cause irritation.  
Notes to Physician:  Acute aspirations of large amounts of oil-laden material may produce a serious aspiration pneumonia. 
Patients who aspirate these oils should be followed for the development of long-term sequelae. Inhalation exposure to oil mists 
below current workplace exposure limits is unlikely to cause pulmonary abnormalities.  
SECTION 5: Firefighting measures 
 
NFPA 704: National Fire Protection Association  
 
Extinguishing Media:  Dry chemical, carbon dioxide, foam, or water spray is recommended.  Water or foam may cause frothing 
of materials heated above 212°F / 100°C.  Carbon dioxide can displace oxygen.  Use caution when applying carbon dioxide in 
confined spaces. Simultaneous use of foam and water on the same surface is to be avoided as water destroys the foam.  
Specific hazards arising from the chemical  
Unusual Fire & Explosion Hazards:  This material may burn, but will not ignite readily. If container is not properly cooled, it 
can rupture in the heat of a fire.  
Hazardous Combustion Products:  Combustion may yield smoke, carbon monoxide, and other products of incomplete 
combustion. Oxides of sulfur, nitrogen or phosphorus may also be formed.  
Special protective actions for fire-fighters:  For fires beyond the initial stage, emergency responders in the immediate hazard 
area should wear protective clothing.  When the potential chemical hazard is unknown, in enclosed or confined spaces, a self 
contained breathing apparatus should be worn.  In addition, wear other appropriate protective equipment as conditions warrant 
(see Section 8). Isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected personnel. Stop spill/release if it can be 
done safely. Move undamaged containers from immediate hazard area if it can be done safely. Water spray may be useful in 
minimizing or dispersing vapors and to protect personnel. Cool equipment exposed to fire with water, if it can be done safely. Avoid 
spreading burning liquid with water used for cooling purposes.  
See Section 9 for Flammable Properties including Flash Point and Flammable (Explosive) Limits  
SECTION 6: Accidental release measures 
 
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures:  This material may burn, but will not ignite readily. 
Keep all sources of ignition away from spill/release. Stay upwind and away from spill/release. Avoid direct contact with material. For 
large spillages, notify persons down wind of the spill/release, isolate immediate hazard area and keep unauthorized personnel out.

Wear appropriate protective equipment, including respiratory protection, as conditions warrant (see Section 8). See Sections 2 and 
7 for additional information on hazards and precautionary measures.  
Environmental Precautions:  Stop and contain spill/release if it can be done safely. Prevent spilled material from entering 
sewers, storm drains, other unauthorized drainage systems, and natural waterways. Use water sparingly to minimize environmental 
contamination and reduce disposal requirements. If spill occurs on water notify appropriate authorities and advise shipping of any 
hazard. Spills into or upon navigable waters, the contiguous zone, or adjoining shorelines that cause a sheen or discoloration on 
the surface of the water, may require notification of the National Response Center (phone number 800-424-8802).  
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up:  Notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable 
regulations. Immediate cleanup of any spill is recommended. Dike far ahead of spill for later recovery or disposal. Absorb spill with 
inert material such as sand or vermiculite, and place in suitable container for disposal. If spilled on water remove with appropriate 
methods (e.g. skimming, booms or absorbents).  In case of soil contamination, remove contaminated soil for remediation or 
disposal, in accordance with local regulations. 
Recommended measures are based on the most likely spillage scenarios for this material; however local conditions and 
regulations may influence or limit the choice of appropriate actions to be taken. See Section 13 for information on appropriate 
disposal.  
SECTION 7: Handling and storage 
 
Precautions for safe handling:  Keep away from flames and hot surfaces. Avoid breathing vapors or mists. Wear protective 
gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection. Wash thoroughly after handling. Contaminated work clothing should not 
be allowed out of the workplace. Use good personal hygiene practices and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (see 
section 8).  Spills will produce very slippery surfaces. Do not enter confined spaces such as tanks or pits without following proper 
entry procedures such as ASTM D-4276 and 29CFR 1910.146. Do not wear contaminated clothing or shoes.  
 
Conditions for safe storage:  Keep container(s) tightly closed and properly labeled. Use and store this material in cool, dry, 
well-ventilated area away from heat and all sources of ignition. Store only in approved containers. Keep away from any 
incompatible material (see Section 10). Protect container(s) against physical damage. 
"Empty" containers retain residue and may be dangerous.  Do not pressurize, cut, weld, braze, solder, drill, grind, or expose such 
containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. They may explode and cause injury or death.  "Empty" drums should 
be completely drained, properly bunged, and promptly shipped to the supplier or a drum reconditioner.   All containers should be 
disposed of in an environmentally safe manner and in accordance with governmental regulations. Before working on or in tanks 
which contain or have contained this material, refer to OSHA regulations, ANSI Z49.1, and other references pertaining to cleaning, 
repairing, welding, or other contemplated operations.  
SECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection 
 
 
 
None.  
None.  
 
Engineering controls:  General ventilation should be adequate for normal conditions of intended use.  Additional engineering 
controls may be necessary if working with the product in enclosed areas and/or at elevated temperatures.  
Eye/Face Protection:  The use of eye protection that meets or exceeds ANSI Z.87.1 is recommended to protect against potential 
eye contact, irritation, or injury.  Depending on conditions of use, a face shield may be necessary.  
Skin/Hand Protection:  The use of gloves impervious to the specific material handled is advised to prevent skin contact. Users 
should check with manufacturers to confirm the breakthrough performance of their products. Depending on exposure and use 
conditions, additional protection may be necessary to prevent skin contact including use of items such as chemical resistant boots, 
aprons, arm covers, hoods, coveralls, or encapsulated suits. Suggested protective materials: Nitrile rubber.
