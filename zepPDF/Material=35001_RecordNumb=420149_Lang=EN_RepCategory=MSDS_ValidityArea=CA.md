Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
Remove to fresh air. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
Immediately flush eye(s) with plenty of water. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Acute specific target organ toxicity effects will differ depending 
on mode of exposure (oral, dermal, and inhalation), the 
organs and systems affected, and any preexisting medical 
conditions.   Symptoms may include respiratory difficulty, 
abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, vomiting, 
central nervous system depression, blurred vision, seizures, 
and unconsciousness - potentially life threatening. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Causes skin irritation. 
Causes damage to organs. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
May cause drowsiness or dizziness. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.

Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers.

Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal.

regulations. 
Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Always replace cap after use. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun
