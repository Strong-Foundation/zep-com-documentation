5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES 
Suitable Extinguishing Media 
Dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog or alcohol-resistant foam.  
  
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media 
CAUTION:  This product has a very low flash point. Use of water spray when fighting fire may be inefficient. Do not use straight 
streams. 
  
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical 
Vapors may form explosive mixtures with air. Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Most vapors are heavier than air.  
They will spread along ground and collect in low or confined areas (sewers, basements, tanks). Vapor explosion hazard indoors, 
outdoors or in sewers. Runoff to sewer may create fire or explosion hazard.

Irritant: Liquid 
 
Hazardous Combustion Products  
Carbon oxides. 
  
Explosion Data  
Sensitivity to Mechanical Impact  
No 
  
Sensitivity to Static Discharge  
Yes 
  
Protective Equipment and Precautions for Firefighters 
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent) and full protective 
gear. Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk. 
 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES FOR INDUSTRIAL SETTING 
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures  
  
Personal Precautions 
ELIMINATE all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area). All 
equipment used when handling the product must be grounded. Do not touch or walk through 
spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. 
  
Other Information 
Water spray may reduce vapor; but may not prevent ignition in closed spaces. 
  
Environmental precautions  
  
Environmental Precautions 
Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. 
  
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up  
  
Methods for Containment 
A vapor suppressing foam may be used to reduce vapors. Absorb or cover with dry earth, sand 
or other non-combustible material and transfer to containers. 
  
Methods for Cleaning Up 
Soak up with inert absorbent material. Use clean non-sparking tools to collect absorbed 
material and transfer to properly labeled containers. Keep in suitable and closed containers for 
disposal.
