 SECTION 6  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Protective Measures:  Eliminate all sources of ignition in the vicinity of the spill or released vapor.  If this
material is released into the work area, evacuate the area immediately.   Monitor area with combustible gas
indicator.
Spill Management:  Stop the source of the release if you can do it without risk.   Contain release to prevent
further contamination of soil, surface water or groundwater.  Clean up spill as soon as possible, observing
precautions in Exposure Controls/Personal Protection. Use appropriate techniques such as applying
non-combustible absorbent materials or pumping.  All equipment used when handling the product must be
grounded.   A vapor suppressing foam may be used to reduce vapors.  Use clean non-sparking tools to
collect absorbed material.  Where feasible and appropriate, remove contaminated soil.  Place contaminated
materials in disposable containers and dispose of in a manner consistent with applicable regulations.
Reporting:  Report spills to local authorities and/or the U.S. Coast Guard's National Response Center at
(800) 424-8802 as appropriate or required.
 SECTION 7  HANDLING AND STORAGE
General Handling Information: Avoid contaminating soil or releasing this material into sewage and
drainage systems and bodies of water.
Precautionary Measures: Liquid evaporates and forms vapor (fumes) which can catch fire and burn with
explosive force.  Invisible vapor spreads easily and can be set on fire by many sources such as pilot lights,
welding equipment, and electrical motors and switches.
  Storage, processing, handling, and use at temperatures above the flash point can produce ignitable
vapors if the liquid is released or vessels are vented.  Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.  Do not
taste or swallow.  Do not breathe vapor or fumes.  Wash thoroughly after handling.  Keep out of the reach
of children.  
Static Hazard: Electrostatic charge may accumulate and create a hazardous condition when handling this
material. To minimize this hazard, bonding and grounding may be necessary but may not, by themselves,
be sufficient. Review all operations which have the potential of generating and accumulating an
electrostatic charge and/or a flammable atmosphere (including tank and container filling, splash filling, tank
cleaning, sampling, gauging, switch loading, filtering, mixing, agitation, and vacuum truck operations) and
use appropriate mitigating procedures.
Container Warnings: Container is not designed to contain pressure. Do not use pressure to empty
container or it may rupture with explosive force.  Empty containers retain product residue (solid, liquid,
and/or vapor) and can be dangerous.  Do not pressurize, cut, weld, braze, solder, drill, grind, or expose
such containers to heat, flame, sparks, static electricity, or other sources of ignition.  They may explode and
cause injury or death.  Empty containers should be completely drained, properly closed, and promptly
returned to a drum reconditioner or disposed of properly.
General Storage Information: DO NOT USE OR STORE near heat, sparks, flames, or hot surfaces .  USE
AND STORE ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREA.  Keep container closed when not in use.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Consider the potential hazards of this material (see Section 2), applicable exposure limits, job activities,
and other substances in the work place when designing engineering controls and selecting personal
protective equipment.  If engineering controls or work practices are not adequate to prevent exposure to
harmful levels of this material, the personal protective equipment listed below is recommended.  The user
should read and understand all instructions and limitations supplied with the equipment since protection is
usually provided for a limited time or under certain circumstances.
ENGINEERING CONTROLS:
Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to control airborne levels
below the recommended exposure limits.
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
Eye/Face Protection: No special eye protection is normally required.  Where splashing is possible, wear
safety glasses with side shields as a good safety practice.
Skin Protection: Wear protective clothing to prevent skin contact. Selection of protective clothing may
include gloves, apron, boots, and complete facial protection depending on operations conducted.
Suggested materials for protective gloves include:  Chlorinated Polyethylene (or Chlorosulfonated
Polyethylene), Nitrile Rubber, Polyurethane, Viton.  
Respiratory Protection: Determine if airborne concentrations are below the recommended occupational
exposure limits for jurisdiction of use.  If airborne concentrations are above the acceptable limits, wear an
approved respirator that provides adequate protection from this material, such as:  Air-Purifying Respirator
for Organic Vapors.
Use a positive pressure air-supplying respirator in circumstances where air-purifying respirators may not
provide adequate protection.
