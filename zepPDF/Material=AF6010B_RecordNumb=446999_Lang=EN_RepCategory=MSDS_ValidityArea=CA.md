Environmental Precautions  
Prevent entry to sewers and public waters. 
 
Methods and Material for Containment and Cleaning Up  
For Containment: Cautiously neutralize spill. Contain any spills with dikes or absorbents to prevent migration and entry into sewers 
or streams. 
Methods for Cleaning Up: Clear up spills immediately and dispose of waste safely. Absorb and/or contain spill with inert material, 
then place in suitable container. Ventilate area. Contact competent authorities after a spill. 
Reference to Other Sections 
See heading 8, Exposure Controls and Personal Protection. 
 
SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Precautions for Safe Handling  
Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures. Wash hands and other exposed areas 
with mild soap and water before eating, drinking, or smoking and again when leaving work. Do not eat, drink or smoke when using

when not in use. Keep away from heat, extremely high temperatures and incompatible materials. 
Incompatible Materials: Strong bases. Strong oxidizers. 
Specific End Use(s)  
For professional use only. Acid cleaner for soak, manual, and foam cleaning of food processing equipment. Effective for the removal 
of hardness scale and rust. 
Suitable Extinguishing Media: Use extinguishing media appropriate for surrounding fire.  
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use a heavy water stream. A heavy water stream may spread burning liquid.  
Fire Hazard: Not flammable. 
Explosion Hazard: Product is not explosive, however contact with metals may release explosive hydrogen gas.  
Reactivity: Thermal decomposition generates: Corrosive vapors and toxic fumes. Reacts violently with strong bases.
