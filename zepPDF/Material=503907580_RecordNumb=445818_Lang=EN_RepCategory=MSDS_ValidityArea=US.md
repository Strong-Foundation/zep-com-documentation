5. Fire-fighting measures
6. Accidental release measures
Most important symptoms/effects,
acute and delayed.
May cause allergic skin reaction. Dermatis. Rash.
Personal precautions, protective
equipment and emergency
procedures:
Wear protective equipment when working.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately.
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent
inhalation of mist.
Do not touch or walk through spillage.
Specific extinguishing methods:
Special protective equipment and
precautions for fire fighters:
Spray water to the surrounding facilities for cooling.
Keep unauthorized persons off the site of occurrence of fire and
the surroundings.
Even after extinction, cool containers thoroughly with plenty of
water.
Wear fire/flame resistant/retardant clothing.
Fight fire from windward direction while wearing protective
equipment. If contact with skin is expected, wear impervious
protective equipment and gloves.
Use air-breathing apparatus and protective clothing whenever
necessary.
Mist of loaded liquid, dry chemicals, carbon dioxide, fire foam,
and dry sand are effective.
Use of straight stream of water can cause a risk of spreading
fire.
In some cases of fire, may release irritant gases.
When burnt, may generate carbon monoxide and other toxic gases.
Suitable extinguishing media:
Unsuitable extinguishing media:
Specific hazards arising from the
chemical:
No information.
Eye contact:
Ingestion:
Protection for first aid person:
If skin irritation occurs: Get medical advice/attention.
Rinse with clean water carefully for several minutes. Remove
contact lenses if present and if removal is easy, then continue
rinsing. Rinse for 15 minutes at a minimum and seek medical
attention.
If eye irritation persists: Get medical advice/attention.
Do not induce vomiting. Drink [one glass] [two glasses] of water.

7. Handling and storage
Ventilation
requirements:
Precautions for safe
handling:
Contact avoidance:
Technical measures:
Avoid falling, dropping, exposing to shock, or dragging of
containers.
Wash hands and face thoroughly after handling.
Be careful with fire.
Wear protective gloves when opening containers to eliminate a risk
of hand injury.
Use care to keep away from any possible contact with halogens,
strong acids, alkalis, and acidifying substances.
Keep away from any possible contact with sparks, open flames, and
high-temperature materials, and do not allow release of vapor
without justification.
Use pumps or other proper equipment for taking out from
containers. Do not siphon with your mouth using a tube. Do not
drink.
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent
inhalation of mist.
In case of vapor/mist dispersion, install a closed system, local
ventilation system, and/or other proper equipment for the sources
of vapor/mist generation.
Avoid rough handling of containers such as falling, dropping,
exposing to shock, and dragging.
Maintain adequate ventilation when handling indoors.
Environmental precautions:
Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up:
Prevention of second accident:
At sea, install oil spill containment booms to prevent spreading
of spills and absorb with absorption mat or other proper
materials.
In case of spillage in small quantity, collect spillage by
absorbing with earth, sand, sawdust, waste, or other proper
materials.
In case of spillage in large quantity, enclose with embankment to
prevent spreading of spillage and collect spillage in empty
containers to the extent possible.
In case of spillage, immediately inform the organizations
concerned of the spillage to prevent possible accidents and
spreading of spillage.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately and make
fire-extinguishing agents available. Remove spillage completely,
and ventilate and clean the site and the surroundings.
Pay attention to the site of spillage, which is slippery.
Prevent spreading of oil spill with earth and sand, sandbags, or
other proper materials and use care not to allow the oil spill to
flow to  street drains, sewer systems, and rivers.
