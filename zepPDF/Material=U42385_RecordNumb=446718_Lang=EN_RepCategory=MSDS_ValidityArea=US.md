Section 4.  First Aid Measures 
Eye Contact 
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water, occasionally lifting the upper and lower eyelids.  Check 
for and remove any contact lenses.  Continue to rinse for 15 minutes.  Seek medical attention if 
irritation develops. 
 
 
Skin Contact 
Immediately flush skin with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated 
clothing and shoes.  Seek medical attention if irritation develops. 
 
 
Inhalation 
Move exposed person to fresh air. If not breathing, if breathing is irregular or if respiratory arrest 
occurs, provide artificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel. Seek medical attention if 
irritation develops. 
 
 
Ingestion 
Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. Never give anything by 
mouth to an unconscious person. Seek medical attention. 
 
 
Section 5.  Fire Fighting Measures

Special Information: 
In the event of a fire, wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self-
contained breathing apparatus with full faceplate operated in the pressure 
demand mode. 
 
 
Hazardous Decomposition 
Products: 
Oxides of carbon  
 
 
Section 6.  Accidental Release Measures 
Personal precautions 
Wear the required PPE.  Ensure adequate ventilation, and evacuate personnel to 
safe areas if necessary. 
 
 
Environmental Precautions 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so.  Do not let product enter 
drains. 
 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning 
up 
Clean up with spill with a suitable absorbent, and sweep up and containerize for 
reclamation or disposal.  Note:  US Regulations (CERCLA) may require reporting 
spills and releases to soil, water, and air in excess of reportable quantities.  See 
Section 15 for regulatory information. 
 
 
Section 7.  Handling and Storage 
Precautions for Safe 
Handling 
Use appropriate PPE (see section 8). Do not ingest. Do not get in eyes or on skin 
or clothing. Avoid breathing vapor or mist. After handling, always wash hands 
thoroughly. Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. 
 
 
Conditions for Safe 
Storage 
Store in original container protected from physical damage in a dry, cool and well-
ventilated area, away from incompatible materials (see section 10) and food and 
drink. Keep container tightly closed and sealed until ready for use. Store between 
the following temperatures: 40°F - 100°F.

Ventilation System: 
A system of local and/or general exhaust is recommended to keep employee exposures as 
low as possible.  Local exhaust ventilation is generally preferred because it can control the 
emissions of the contaminant at its source, preventing dispersion of it into the general work 
area.   
 
 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): 
 
 
Eyes: 
Splash goggles 
 
 
Body: 
Proper clothing, gloves 
 
 
Respiratory: 
Use with adequate ventilation.  Provide exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls to 
keep the airborne concentrations of vapors below their respective occupational exposure 
limits.
