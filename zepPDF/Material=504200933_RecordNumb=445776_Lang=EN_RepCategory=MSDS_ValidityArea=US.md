4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Inhalation: 
Move to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is 
difficult, give oxygen. If symptoms develop and persist, get medical attention.  
 
Skin contact: 
Wipe off paste with paper towel or cloth. Wash with soap and water.  
 
Eye contact: 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist.  
 
Ingestion: 
Do not induce vomiting. Consult a physician if necessary.  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media: 
Water spray (fog), foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.   
 
Special firefighting procedures: 
Wear full protective clothing. Wear self-contained breathing apparatus.  
 
Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
Not a fire hazard.  
 
Hazardous combustion products: 
Irritating and/or toxic fumes and gases may be emitted upon the product's 
decomposition. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and 
unprotected personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Wear appropriate 
protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Do not allow product to 
enter sewer or waterways.  
 
Clean-up methods: 
Absorb spill with inert material.  Shovel material into appropriate container for 
disposal. Store in a partly filled, closed container until disposal. Dispose of 
according to Federal, State and local governmental regulations. Allow to stand 
uncovered for 48 hours to let carbon dioxide escape.  
 
7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling: 
Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Do not wear contact lenses.  
 
Storage: 
Keep the container tightly closed and in a cool, well-ventilated place. Store

Engineering controls: 
Provide adequate local exhaust ventilation to maintain worker exposure below 
exposure limits.

When dusts or thermal processing fumes are generated and ventilation is not 
sufficient to effectively remove them, appropriate NIOSH/MSHA approved 
respiratory protection must be provided.  
 
Eye/face protection: 
Safety goggles or safety glasses with side shields. Full face protection should 
be used if the potential for splashing or spraying of product exists.  
 
Skin protection: 
Use impermeable gloves and protective clothing as necessary to prevent skin 
contact.
