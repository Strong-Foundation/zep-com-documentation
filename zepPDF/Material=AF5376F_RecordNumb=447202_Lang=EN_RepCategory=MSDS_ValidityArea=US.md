SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Description of First Aid Measures 
General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where 
possible). 
Inhalation: Remove to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. Obtain medical attention if breathing 
difficulty persists. 
Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. Immediately call a POISON 
CENTER or doctor/physician. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. 
Obtain medical attention if irritation persists. 
Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Immediately call a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician.

General: Causes severe skin burns and serious eye damage.  
Inhalation: None under normal and intended conditions of use.  
Skin Contact: Causes severe skin burns.  
Eye Contact: Causes serious eye damage.  
Ingestion: Ingestion is likely to be harmful or have adverse effects. Contact may cause immediate severe irritation progressing 
quickly to chemical burns. 
Chronic Symptoms: Not available. 
Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed 
If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. 
SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing Media
