recovery position. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
If large quantities of this material are swallowed, call a 
physician immediately. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Aspiration may cause pulmonary oedema and pneumonitis. 
Symptoms may include shortness of breath, dry cough, and 
irritation of the nose, eyes, lips, mouth, and throat. 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
May be fatal if swallowed and enters airways. 
Causes skin irritation. 
Causes serious eye irritation. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Alcohol-resistant foam 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Dry chemical 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke

Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored

protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Use personal protective equipment. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
Sweep up and shovel into suitable containers for disposal. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. 
Do not allow contact with air. 
Do not spray on a naked flame or any incandescent material. 
Keep away from sources of ignition - No smoking. Keep away 
from children. 
Do not repack. 
Use ventilation adequate to exhaust vapours. See the safety 
datasheet. 
Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and protective suit. 
Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Always replace cap after use. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: Do not store together with oxidizing and self-igniting products. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. 
BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Keep away from oxidizing agents and strongly acid or alkaline 
materials. 
Do not freeze.
