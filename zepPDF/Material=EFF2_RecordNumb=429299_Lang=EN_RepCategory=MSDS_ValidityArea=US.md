Suitable extinguishing media 
: Alcohol-resistant foam 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Dry chemical 
Water spray jet 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment.

SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Persons susceptible to skin sensitisation problems or asthma, 
allergies, chronic or recurrent respiratory disease should not 
be employed in any process in which this mixture is being 
used. 
Always replace cap after use. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
No smoking. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. 
Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and 
kept upright to prevent leakage. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Oxidizing agents
