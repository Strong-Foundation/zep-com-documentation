4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Inhalation: 
Move to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is 
difficult, give oxygen. Get medical attention.  
 
Skin contact: 
Remove contaminated clothing and footwear. Immediately flush skin with 
plenty of water (using soap, if available). If symptoms develop and persist, get 
medical attention. Wash clothing before reuse.  
 
Eye contact: 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. Get immediate medical attention.  
 
Ingestion: 
Keep individual calm. Do not induce vomiting: contains petroleum distillates 
and/or aromatic solvents. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious 
person. Get immediate medical attention. If vomiting occurs, prevent 
aspiration by keeping the patient's head below the knees.  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
Notes to physician: 
This material is an aspiration hazard.  Potential danger from aspiration must 
be weighed against possible oral toxicity when deciding whether to induce 
vomiting. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media: 
Water spray (fog), foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide. Do not use high 
volume water jet.   
 
Special firefighting procedures: 
Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing, such as 
turn-out gear. Water may be unsuitable as an extinguishing media, but may be 
helpful in keeping adjacent containers cool. Keep personnel upwind of fire.

Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
Contents under pressure.  Do not puncture or incinerate pressurized 
containers.   Containers exposed to fire should be cooled with water to prevent 
vapor pressure buildup which could result in container rupture.  If a leak or 
spill has not ignited, use water spray to disperse vapors.  The liquid is volatile 
and gives off invisible vapors.   Vapors may form explosive mixtures with air.   
Do not handle or store near an open flame, heat or other sources of ignition.   
Hydrocarbon solvents are basically non-conductors of electricity and can 
become electrostatically charged during mixing, filtering or pumping at high 
flow rates.  If this charge reaches a significantly high level, sparks can form 
that may ignite vapors of flammable liquids.  
 
Hazardous combustion products: 
Oxides of carbon. Irritating organic vapours. Collect contaminated fire 
extinguishing water separately. This must not be discharged into drains. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected 
personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Do not allow product to enter sewer or waterways. Advise authorities if product 
has entered or may enter sewers, water sources or extensive land areas. This 
product is insoluble in water and will float on surface.  
 
Clean-up methods: 
Remove all sources of ignition. Ventilate area. Soak up with inert absorbent 
material (e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). Store in 
a closed metal container until ready for disposal. Keep upwind of the spilled 
material and isolate exposure. Refer to Section 8 "Exposure Controls / 
Personal Protection" prior to clean up.  
 
7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling: 
Do not puncture or incinerate pressurized containers. During use and until all 
vapors are gone:  Keep area ventilated - do not smoke; extinguish all flames, 
pilot lights, and heaters; turn off stoves, electrical tools and appliances, and 
any other sources of ignition. Make sure containers are properly grounded 
before use or transfer of material. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. 
Do not breathe gas/fumes/vapor/spray. Do not taste or swallow. Wash 
thoroughly after handling. For operations where eye or face contact could 
occur, provide safety shower and eyewash fountain.  
 
Storage: 
For safe storage, store at or below 48.8 °C (119.8 °F) 
Keep in a cool, well ventilated area away from heat, sparks and open flame. 
Keep container tightly closed until ready for use. Do not puncture, incinerate, 
or expose to temperatures above 48.9 °C (120 °F).

8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
 
Employers should complete an assessment of all workplaces to determine the need for, and selection of, proper exposure 
controls and protective equipment for each task performed.

Potential Health Effects/Symptoms 
 
Inhalation: 
Vapors and mists will irritate nose and throat and possibly eyes. High vapor concentrations 
(greater than approximately 1000 ppm) may cause headaches, dizziness, anesthesia, 
drowsiness, unconsciousness, and other central nervous system effects, including death. 
Skin contact: 
Causes skin irritation. Solvent action can dry and defat the skin, causing the skin to crack, 
leading to dermatitis. 
Eye contact: 
Causes serious eye irritation.  
Ingestion: 
This product may be fatal if it is swallowed. Aspiration may occur during swallowing or vomiting, 
resulting in lung damage. May cause central nervous system effects, such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, confusion, and breathing difficulties.
