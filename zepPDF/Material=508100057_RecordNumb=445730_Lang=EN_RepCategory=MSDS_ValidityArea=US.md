essary. 
SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
Personal precautions, protec-
tive equipment and emer-
gency procedures 
 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive concentra-
tions. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
 
: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible ab-
sorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, ver-
miculite) and place in container for disposal according to local 
/ national regulations (see section 13). 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Advice on protection against 
fire and explosion 
 
:  Do not spray on a naked flame or any incandescent material. 
Take necessary action to avoid static electricity discharge 
(which might cause ignition of organic vapours). Keep away 
from open flames, hot surfaces and sources of ignition.  
 
Advice on safe handling 
 
: Avoid formation of aerosol. 
Do not breathe vapours/dust. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the ap-
plication area.
