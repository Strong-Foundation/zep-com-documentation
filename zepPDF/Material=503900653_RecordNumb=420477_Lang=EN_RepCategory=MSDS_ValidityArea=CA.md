SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
Get medical attention immediately. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice.

physician or poison control center. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Causes serious eye irritation. 
May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated

SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Alcohol-resistant foam 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Dry chemical 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments.
