media
During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed.
Specific hazards arising from
the chemical
Self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing must be worn in case of fire.
Special protective equipment
and precautions for firefighters
Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk.
Fire fighting
equipment/instructions
Use standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials.
Specific methods

General fire hazards
6. Accidental release measures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.
Personal precautions,
protective equipment and
emergency procedures
Large Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this is
possible. Cover with plastic sheet to prevent spreading. Absorb in vermiculite, dry sand or earth
and place into containers. Following product recovery, flush area with water.
Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly to
remove residual contamination.
Never return spills to original containers for re-use. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.
Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up
Avoid discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground.
Environmental precautions
7. Handling and storage
Observe good industrial hygiene practices.
Precautions for safe handling
Store in original tightly closed container. Store away from incompatible materials (see Section 10
of the SDS).

Good general ventilation (typically 10 air changes per hour) should be used. Ventilation rates
should be matched to conditions. If applicable, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation,
or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below recommended exposure limits. If
exposure limits have not been established, maintain airborne levels to an acceptable level.
Appropriate engineering
controls
Individual protection measures, such as personal protective equipment
Wear safety glasses with side shields (or goggles).
Eye/face protection
Skin protection
Wear appropriate chemical resistant gloves. Suitable gloves can be recommended by the glove
supplier.
Hand protection
Wear suitable protective clothing.
Other
In case of insufficient ventilation, wear suitable respiratory equipment.
Respiratory protection
Wear appropriate thermal protective clothing, when necessary.
Thermal hazards
Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing after handling the material
and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking.  Routinely wash work clothing and protective
equipment to remove contaminants.
