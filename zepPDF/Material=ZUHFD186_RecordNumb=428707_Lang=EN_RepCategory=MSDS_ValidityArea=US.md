concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
Prevent product from entering drains. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling
