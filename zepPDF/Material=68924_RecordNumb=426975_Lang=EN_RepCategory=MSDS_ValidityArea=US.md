SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Do not leave the victim unattended. 
Get medical attention immediately. 
Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
 
If inhaled 
: Move to fresh air. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
If breathing has stopped, apply artificial respiration. 
If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Take off contaminated clothing and shoes immediately. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, 
for at least 15 minutes. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
If conscious, drink plenty of water. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Use water spray, alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical or

containment and cleaning up 
: Contain spillage, soak up with non-combustible absorbent 
material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, vermiculite) 
and transfer to a container for disposal according to local / 
national regulations (see section 13). 
Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area.
