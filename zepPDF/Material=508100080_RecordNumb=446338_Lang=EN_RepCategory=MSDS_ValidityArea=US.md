Advice for Firefighters:  Wear self-contained breathing apparatus 
for fire-fighting if necessary.   
 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency 
Procedures:  Wear appropriate personal protective equipment as 
specified in Section 8.   
Environmental Precautions and Methods and Materials for 
Containment and Cleaning Up:  P-80 EMULSION can be 
treated in sewage / wastewater treatment facilities.  Do not 
discharge to surface waterways.   Spills will present a slip hazard. 
Clean up spills with absorbent material or mop.  Dried  
P-80 EMULSION spills will be sticky.  Clean up residue with soap 
and water. 
 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Precautions for Safe Handling and Conditions for Safe Storage, 
Including Any Incompatibilities:  P-80 EMULSION requires no 
special ventilation.  Safety glasses and gloves should be worn 
(See Section 8.)  P-80 EMULSION should be stored in a cool place 
in its original container and protected from sunlight.  Keep 
container closed when not in use to prevent bacterial 
contamination.  Mix or shake P-80 EMULSION before use.  
Recommended storage temperature is 2–30°C (36–86°F).  Do not 
allow product to freeze.  The shelf life of P-80 EMULSION is two 
years from the date of manufacture when stored in the original
