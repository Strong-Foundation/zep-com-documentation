FIRST AID MEASURES
No additional information
Use dry chemical, alcohol foam, all purpose AFFF or carbon dioxide to extinguish fire.
Remove source of exposure or move person to fresh air and keep comfortable for
breathing. If experiencing respiratory symptoms: Call a doctor. If breathing is difficult,
trained personnel should administer emergency oxygen if advised to do so by the doctor
If you feel unwell or concerned: Get medical advice/attention. Rinse mouth. Do NOT
induce vomiting. If vomiting occurs naturally, lie on your side, in the recovery position.
DO NOT direct a solid stream of water or foam into hot, burning pools of liquid since this
may cause frothing and increase fire intensity. Frothing can be violent and possibly
endanger any firefighter standing too close to the burning liquid. Use water spray to cool
fire exposed containers and structures until fire is out if it can be done with minimal risk.
Avoid spreading burning material with water used for cooling purposes. Wear full
firefighting turn-out gear (full Bunker gear), and respiratory protection (SCBA). 
Not determined.  Care should always be exercised in dust/mist areas.
Take off contaminated clothing, shoes and leather goods (e.g. watchbands, belts). Wash
skin with lukewarm, gently flowing water and mild soap until product is removed. Call a
doctor if you feel unwell. If skin irritation or rash occurs: Get medical advice/attention.
Discard contaminated clothing. 
If irritation occurs, cautiously rinse eyes with lukewarm, gently flowing water for 5
minutes,
while
holding
the
eyelids
open.
If
eye
irritation
persists:
Get
medical
advice/attention. 
FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
160°C by Cleveland Open Cup Tester.
Not determined.
ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Not determined.
Fires involving this product may release oxides of carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and
sulfur;  reactive hydrocarbons and irritating vapors.
Dense smoke may be generated while burning.
Toxic fumes, gases or vapors may
evolve on burning. High temperatures may create heavy flammable vapors that may
settle along ground level and low spots to create an invisible fire hazard.
Dispose of fire debris and contaminated extinguishing water in accordance with official
regulations. 
Immediately turn off or isolate any source of ignition (pilot lights, electrical equipment,
flames, heaters, etc.). Evacuate area and ventilate. Personnel wearing proper protective
equipment should contain spill immediately with inert materials (sand, earth, chemical
spill pads of cotton) by forming dikes. Dikes should be placed to contain spill in a manner
that will prevent material from entering sewers and waterways.
Large spill, once
contained, may be picked up using explosion proof, non-sparking vacuum pumps,
shovels, or buckets, and disposed of in suitable containers for disposal.
Clean up
residue with an appropriate solvent. If a large spill occurs notify appropriate authorities.
In case of road spill or accident contact Chem-Trec (800-424-9300).
Try to contain large spills with floating booms to prevent spill from spreading. Remove
from surface by skimming or with suitable adsorbents.
If a large spill occurs notify
appropriate authorities (normally the National Response Center or Coast Guard at 800-
424-8802).

Other protection:
None required if ventilation is adequate.
Otherwise a respiratory protection program
meeting OSHA 1910.134 and ANSI Z88.2 requirements must be followed.
Where
misting may occur, wear an MSHA/NIOSH approved (or equivalent) half-mask form
dust/mist air purifying respirator.
Eye protection is strongly recommended.
Wear safety glasses with side shields or
vented/splash proof goggles (ANSI Z87.1 or approved equivalent).

TWA – Time Weighted Average is the employee’s average airborne exposure in 
any 8-hour work shift of a 40-hour work week which shall not be exceeded.
STEL – Short Term Exposure Limit is the employee’s 15-minute time weighted 
average exposure which shall not be exceeded at any time during a work day 
unless another time limit is specified.
HANDLING AND STORAGE
EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
Do not empty into drains.
All disposals must comply with federal, state, and local
regulations. The material, if spilled or discarded may be a regulated waste. Refer to
state and local regulations. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations may apply
for transporting this material when spilled.  See Section 14.
CAUTION - If spilled material is cleaned up using a regulated solvent, the resulting waste
mixture will be regulated.
Keep containers closed when not in use. Do not transfer to unmarked containers. Empty
containers retain product residue which may exhibit hazards of material, therefore do not
pressurize, cut, glaze, weld, or use for any other purposes. Return drums to reclamation
centers for proper cleaning and reuse.
Handling temperatures should not exceed 60°C (140°F) to minimize danger of burns.
Open containers carefully in a well ventilated area or use appropriate respiratory
protection.  Wash thoroughly after handling.
Store containers away from heat, sparks, open flame, or oxidizing materials. Extended
storage at excessive temperatures may produce odorous and toxic fumes from product
decomposition.
No additional information.
Applicable mainly to persons in repeated contact situations such as packaging of
product, service/maintenance, and cleanup/spill control personnel.
Impervious, chemically resistant gloves such as neoprene or nitrile rubber to avoid skin
sensitization and absorption.
Use of an apron and overboots of chemically impervious materials such as neoprene or
nitrile rubber is recommended based on level of activity and exposure. If handling hot
material use insulated protective equipment. Launder soiled clothes. Properly dispose of
contaminated leather articles and other materials which cannot be decontaminated.
