SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
 
: Remove contaminated clothing. If irritation develops, get 
medical attention. 
If on skin, rinse well with water. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
 
In case of eye contact 
 
: Immediately flush eye(s) with plenty of water. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
 
If swallowed 
 
: Obtain medical attention. 
Rinse mouth with water. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
 
: Effects of acute ethylene glycol poisoning appear in three 
fairly distinct stages.  The initial stage occurs shortly after 
exposure, lasts 6-12 hours, and is characterized by central 
nervous system effects (transient exhilaration, nausea, 
vomiting, and in severe cases, coma, convulsions, and 
possible death).  The second stage lasts from 12-36 hours 
after exposure and is initiated by the onset of coma.  This

4 / 21 
phase is characterized by tachypnia, tachycardia, mild 
hypotension, cyanosis, and in severe cases, pulmonary 
edema, bronchopneumonia, cardiac enlargement, and 
congestive failure.  The final stage occurs 24-72 post-
exposure and is characterized by renal failure, ranging from a 
mild increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine followed 
by recovery, to complete anuria with acute tubular necrosis 
that can lead to death.  Oxaluria is found in most cases.  The 
most significant laboratory finding in ethylene glycol 
intoxication is severe metabolic acidosis. 
No symptoms known or expected. 
Harmful if swallowed. 
Causes skin irritation. 
Causes serious eye irritation. 
May damage fertility or the unborn child. 
May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated 
exposure if swallowed. 
 
Notes to physician 
 
: This product contains ethylene glycol.  Ethanol decreases the 
metabolism of ethylene glycol to toxic metabolites.  Ethanol 
should be administered as soon as possible in cases of 
severe poisoning since the elimination half-life of ethylene 
glycol is 3 hours.  If medical care will be delayed several 
hours, give the patient three to four 1-ounce oral "shots" of 86-
proof or higher whiskey before or during transport to the 
hospital.  Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole) is an effective 
antagonist of alcohol dehydrogenase, and as such, may be 
used as an antidote in the treatment of ethylene glycol 
poisoning.  Hemodialysis effectively removes ethylene glycol 
and its metabolites from the body. 
 
 
 
 No hazards which require special first aid measures. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
Water spray 
Foam 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Dry chemical 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
 
: High volume water jet 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
 
: If product is heated above its flash point it will produce vapors 
sufficient to support combustion.  Vapors are heavier than air 
and may travel along the ground and be ignited by heat, pilot

Engineering measures 
: Provide sufficient mechanical (general and/or local exhaust) 
ventilation to maintain exposure below exposure guidelines (if 
applicable) or below levels that cause known, suspected or 
apparent adverse effects. 
 
Personal protective equipment 
Respiratory protection 
:  In the case of vapour formation use a respirator with an 
approved filter. 
 
 
  
A NIOSH-approved air-purifying respirator with an appropriate 
cartridge and/or filter may be permissible under certain 
circumstances where airborne concentrations are expected to 
exceed exposure limits (if applicable) or if overexposure has 
otherwise been determined.  Protection provided by air-
purifying respirators is limited.  Use a positive pressure, air-
supplied respirator if there is any potential for uncontrolled 
release, exposure levels are not known or any other 
circumstances where an air-purifying respirator may not 
provide adequate protection. 
 
 
  
No personal respiratory protective equipment normally 
required. 
 
Hand protection 
    Remarks 
:  The suitability for a specific workplace should be discussed 
with the producers of the protective gloves.  
 
Eye protection 
:  Wear chemical splash goggles when there is the potential for 
exposure of the eyes to liquid, vapor or mist. 
 
Skin and body protection 
: 
Wear resistant gloves (consult your safety equipment 
supplier). 
Wear as appropriate: 
Impervious clothing 
Safety shoes 
Choose body protection according to the amount and 
concentration of the dangerous substance at the work place. 
Discard gloves that show tears, pinholes, or signs of wear. 
 
Hygiene measures 
: 
Wash hands before breaks and at the end of workday. 
When using do not eat or drink. 
When using do not smoke.
