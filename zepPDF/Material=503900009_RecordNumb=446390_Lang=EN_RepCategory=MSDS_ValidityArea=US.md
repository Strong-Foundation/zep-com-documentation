4.1 First Aid Measures  
General Advice
If symptoms persist, call a physician. Take a copy of the Safety Data Sheet when going for
medical treatment.
Eye Contact
Immediately flush with plenty of water. After initial flushing, remove any contact lenses and
continue flushing for at least 15 minutes. Keep eye wide open while rinsing. If eye irritation
persists: Get medical advice or attention. IF exposed or concerned: Get medical advice.
Skin Contact
Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water while removing all contaminated
clothes and shoes. Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. Call a physician
immediately.
Inhalation
In case of inadequate ventilation wear respiratory protection. If breathing difficulties
develop, move victim away from source of exposure and into fresh air in a position
comfortable for breathing. If unconscious place in recovery position and seek medical
advice. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. Call a
physician immediately.
Ingestion
Do not induce vomiting without medical advice. If vomiting occurs naturally, have casualty
lean forward to reduce the risk of aspiration. Rinse mouth. Never give anything by mouth to
an unconscious person. Call a physician or poison control center immediately.
Protection of First-aiders
Use personal protective equipment. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing.
4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed  
Symptoms
See Section 11 for additional Toxicological information.
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed  
Notes to Physician
Treat symptomatically.

5.1  Suitable Extinguishing Media: 
Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local
circumstances and the surrounding environment
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media:
Do not use a solid water stream as it may scatter and spread fire.
5.2 Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical 
Keep product and empty container away from heat and sources
of ignition.
Hazardous combustion products
During a fire, smoke may contain the original material in addition
to combustion products of varying composition which may be
toxic and / or irritating.  Combustion products may include and
are not limited to:
Carbon oxides
Oxides of Phosphorus
Sensitivity to mechanical impact:
No data available.
5.3 Protective Equipment and Precautions for Firefighters: 
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus
pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent) and
full protective gear.
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures  
Personal precautions
Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Avoid breathing vapors or mists. Use personal
protection recommended in Section 8. Ensure adequate ventilation. Remove all sources of
ignition.
6.2. Environmental precautions 
Environmental Precautions
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not allow into any sewer, on the
ground or into any body of water. Prevent product from entering drains. Local authorities
should be advised if significant spillages cannot be contained. Do not flush into surface
water or sanitary sewer system. Large Spills: Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery
and disposal. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.
6.3 Methods and material for containment and cleaning up  
Methods for Clean-up
Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth,
diatomaceus earth, vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to local /
national regulations (see section 13).
Spill Management  
LARGE SPILLS
Eliminate sources of ignition.  Prevent additional discharge of material if possible to do so
without hazard.  For small spills implement cleanup procedures; for large spills implement
cleanup procedures and, if in public area, keep public away and advise authorities.  Also, if
this product is subject to CERCLA reporting (see Section 15 Regulatory Information) notify
the National Response Center.
WATER SPILLS
Prevent liquid entering sewers, watercourses, or low areas.  Contain spilled liquid with sand
or earth.  Recover by pumping or with suitable absorbent.  If liquid is too viscous for
pumping, scrape up.  Consult an expert on disposal of recovered material and ensure
conformity to local disposal regulations.

8.2 Exposure controls  
Appropriate engineering controls
Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas. Consider the potential hazards of
this material (see Section 2), applicable exposure limits, job activities, and other substances
in the work place when designing engineering controls and selecting personal protective
equipment.  If engineering controls or work practices are not adequate to prevent exposure
to harmful levels of this material, the personal protective equipment listed below is
recommended.  The user should read and understand all instructions and limitations
supplied with the equipment since protection is usually provided for a limited time or under
certain circumstances.
Personal Protective Equipment 
Eye/face protection
Safety glasses equipped with side shields are recommended as minimum protection in
industrial settings. If splashes are likely to occur wear tight fitting safety goggles and/or
face-shield.
Skin protection
Wear protective gloves/clothing. Long sleeved clothing. Choose the appropriate protective
clothing and gloves based on the tasks being performed to avoid exposed skin surfaces.
Glove Type:  Neoprene, Nitriles
Respiratory protection
No special protective equipment required. If exposure limits are exceeded or irritation is
experienced, NIOSH/MSHA approved respiratory protection should be worn.
Positive-pressure supplied air respirators may be required for high airborne contaminant
concentrations.  Respiratory protection must be provided in accordance with current local

12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION
12.1 Ecotoxicity 
Ecotoxicity effects
Harmful to aquatic life. Harmful to aquatic life with long lasting effects. Plants and animals
may experience harmful or fatal effects when coated with petroleum products.
Petroleum-based (mineral) lubricating oils normally will float on water. In stagnant or
slow-flowing waterways, an oil layer can cover a large surface area. As a result, this oil
layer might limit or eliminate natural atmospheric oxygen transport into the water. With time,
if not removed, oxygen depletion in the waterway may be sufficient to cause a fish kill or
create an anaerobic environment.
12.2 Persistence and degradability 
No information available.
