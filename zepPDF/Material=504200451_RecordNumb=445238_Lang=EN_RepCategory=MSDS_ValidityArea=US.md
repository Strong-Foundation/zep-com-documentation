Monitoring Methods 
Monitoring of the concentration of substances in the breathing zone of workers or in the general 
workplace may be required to confirm compliance with an OEL and adequacy of exposure con-
trols. For some substances biological monitoring may also be appropriate. 
Validated exposure measurement methods should be applied by a competent person and sam-
ples analysed by an accredited laboratory. 
Examples of sources of recommended exposure measurement methods are given below or con-
tact the supplier. Further national methods may be available.

Engineering measures 
: The level of  protection and types of controls necessary will 
vary depending upon potential exposure conditions. Select 
controls based on a risk assessment of local circumstances. 
Appropriate measures include: 
Adequate ventilation to control airborne concentrations. 
 
 
 Where material is heated, sprayed or mist formed, there is 
greater potential for airborne concentrations to be generated. 
 
 
 General Information: 
Define procedures for safe handling and maintenance of 
controls. 
Educate and train workers in the hazards and control 
measures relevant to normal activities associated with this 
product. 
Ensure appropriate selection, testing and maintenance of 
equipment used to control exposure, e.g. personal protective 
equipment, local exhaust ventilation. 
Drain down system prior to equipment break-in or mainte-
nance. 
Retain drain downs in sealed storage pending disposal or 
subsequent recycle. 
Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as 
washing hands after handling the material and before eating, 
drinking, and/or smoking.  Routinely wash work clothing and 
protective equipment to remove contaminants.  Discard con-
taminated clothing and footwear that cannot be cleaned. 
Practice good housekeeping. 
 
Personal protective equipment 
Respiratory protection 
 
: No respiratory protection is ordinarily required under normal 
conditions of use. 
In accordance with good industrial hygiene practices, precau-
tions should be taken to avoid breathing of material.

tions to a level which is adequate to protect worker health, 
select respiratory protection equipment suitable for the spe-
cific conditions of use and meeting relevant legislation. 
Check with respiratory protective equipment suppliers. 
Where air-filtering respirators are suitable, select an appro-
priate combination of mask and filter. 
Select a filter suitable for the combination of organic gases 
and vapours  [Type A/Type P boiling point >65°C (149°F)]. 
 
Hand protection 
    Remarks 
 
: Where hand contact with the product may occur the use of 
gloves approved to relevant standards (e.g. Europe: EN374, 
US: F739) made from the following materials may provide 
suitable chemical protection. PVC, neoprene or nitrile rubber 
gloves Suitability and durability of a glove is dependent on 
usage, e.g. frequency and duration of contact, chemical re-
sistance of glove material, dexterity. Always seek advice from 
glove suppliers. Contaminated gloves should be replaced. 
Personal hygiene is a key element of effective hand care. 
Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using 
gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Appli-
cation of a non-perfumed moisturizer is recommended.  
For continuous contact we recommend gloves with break-
through time of more than 240 minutes with preference for > 
480 minutes where suitable gloves can be identified. For 
short-term/splash protection we recommend the same, but 
recognize that suitable gloves offering this level of protection 
may not be available and in this case a lower breakthrough 
time maybe acceptable so long as appropriate maintenance 
and replacement regimes are followed. Glove thickness is not 
a good predictor of glove resistance to a chemical as it is 
dependent on the exact composition of the glove material. 
Glove thickness should be typically greater than 0.35 mm 
depending on the glove make and model.  
 
Eye protection 
 
: If material is handled such that it could be splashed into eyes, 
protective eyewear is recommended. 
 
Skin and body protection 
 
: Skin protection is not ordinarily required beyond standard 
work clothes. 
It is good practice to wear chemical resistant gloves. 
 
Protective measures 
 
: Personal protective equipment (PPE) should meet recom-
mended national standards. Check with PPE suppliers. 
 
Environmental exposure controls 
General advice 
:  Take appropriate measures to fulfill the requirements of rele-
vant environmental protection legislation. Avoid contamination 
of the environment by following advice given in Chapter 6.  If 
necessary, prevent undissolved material from being dis-
charged to waste water. Waste water should be treated in a 
municipal or industrial waste water treatment plant before 
discharge to surface water. 
Local guidelines on emission limits for volatile substances 
must be observed for the discharge of exhaust air containing 
vapour.
