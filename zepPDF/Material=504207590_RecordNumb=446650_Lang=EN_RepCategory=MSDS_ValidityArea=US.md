airborne levels above the recommended mineral oil mist exposure limit.  Symptoms of respiratory irritation
may include coughing and difficulty breathing.
DELAYED OR OTHER HEALTH EFFECTS: Not classified           
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed Not Applicable
 SECTION 5  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA: Use water fog, foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide (CO2) to extinguish
flames. 
PROTECTION OF FIRE FIGHTERS:
Fire Fighting Instructions: This material will burn although it is not easily ignited.  See Section 7 for proper
handling and storage.  For fires involving this material, do not enter any enclosed or confined fire space
without proper protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus.
Combustion Products:   Highly dependent on combustion conditions.  A complex mixture of airborne
solids, liquids, and gases including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and unidentified organic compounds
will be evolved when this material undergoes combustion.  Combustion may form oxides of: Nitrogen.
 SECTION 6  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Protective Measures:  Eliminate all sources of ignition in vicinity of spilled material.
Spill Management:  Stop the source of the release if you can do it without risk.   Contain release to prevent
further contamination of soil, surface water or groundwater.  Clean up spill as soon as possible, observing
precautions in Exposure Controls/Personal Protection.  Use appropriate techniques such as applying
non-combustible absorbent materials or pumping.  Where feasible and appropriate, remove contaminated
soil.  Place contaminated materials in disposable containers and dispose of in a manner consistent with
applicable regulations.
Reporting:  Report spills to local authorities and/or the U.S. Coast Guard's National Response Center at
(800) 424-8802 as appropriate or required.
 SECTION 7  HANDLING AND STORAGE
General Handling Information: Avoid contaminating soil or releasing this material into sewage and
drainage systems and bodies of water.
Precautionary Measures: Keep out of the reach of children.  
Static Hazard: Electrostatic charge may accumulate and create a hazardous condition when handling this
material. To minimize this hazard, bonding and grounding may be necessary but may not, by themselves,
be sufficient. Review all operations which have the potential of generating and accumulating an
electrostatic charge and/or a flammable atmosphere (including tank and container filling, splash filling, tank
cleaning, sampling, gauging, switch loading, filtering, mixing, agitation, and vacuum truck operations) and
use appropriate mitigating procedures.

Container Warnings: Container is not designed to contain pressure. Do not use pressure to empty
container or it may rupture with explosive force.  Empty containers retain product residue (solid, liquid,
and/or vapor) and can be dangerous.  Do not pressurize, cut, weld, braze, solder, drill, grind, or expose
such containers to heat, flame, sparks, static electricity, or other sources of ignition.  They may explode and
cause injury or death.  Empty containers should be completely drained, properly closed, and promptly
returned to a drum reconditioner or disposed of properly.
 SECTION 8  EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Consider the potential hazards of this material (see Section 2), applicable exposure limits, job activities,
and other substances in the work place when designing engineering controls and selecting personal
protective equipment.  If engineering controls or work practices are not adequate to prevent exposure to
harmful levels of this material, the personal protective equipment listed below is recommended.  The user
should read and understand all instructions and limitations supplied with the equipment since protection is
usually provided for a limited time or under certain circumstances.
ENGINEERING CONTROLS:
Use in a well-ventilated area.
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
Eye/Face Protection: No special eye protection is normally required.  Where splashing is possible, wear
safety glasses with side shields as a good safety practice.
Skin Protection: No special protective clothing is normally required.  Where splashing is possible, select
protective clothing depending on operations conducted, physical requirements and other substances in the
workplace.  Suggested materials for protective gloves include:  4H (PE/EVAL), Silver Shield, Viton, Nitrile
Rubber.  
Respiratory Protection: No respiratory protection is normally required.  
If user operations generate an oil mist, determine if airborne concentrations are below the occupational
exposure limit for mineral oil mist.  If not, wear an approved respirator that provides adequate protection
from the measured concentrations of this material.  For air-purifying respirators use a particulate cartridge.
Use a positive pressure air-supplying respirator in circumstances where air-purifying respirators may not
provide adequate protection.
