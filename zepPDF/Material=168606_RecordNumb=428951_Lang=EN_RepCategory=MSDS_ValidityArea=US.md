SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Get medical attention immediately. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician.
