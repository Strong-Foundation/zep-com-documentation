SPECIFIC HAZARDS POSSIBLY ARISING FROM THE CHEMICAL:  Keep containers tightly closed. Closed 
containers may rupture when exposed to extreme heat. Use water spray to keep fire exposed containers cool. During a fire, 
irritating and/or toxic gases and particulate may be generated by thermal decomposition or combustion.  
 
SPECIAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PRECAUTIONS FOR FIRE-FIGHTERS:  Wear full firefighting 
protective clothing, including self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  If water is used, fog nozzles are preferable. 
 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
PERSONAL PRECAUTIONS, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:  Avoid contact. 
Avoid breathing vapors. Use appropriate respiratory protection for large spills or spills in confined area. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS:  Do not contaminate bodies of water, waterways, or ditches, with chemical or 
used container. 
 
METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR CONTAINMENT AND CLEANUP:  Keep non-essential personnel a safe 
distance away from the spill area. Notify appropriate authorities if necessary. Avoid contact. Before attempting cleanup, refer 
to hazard caution information in other sections of the SDS form. Scoop spilled material into an appropriate container for 
proper disposal. (If necessary, use inert absorbent material to aid in containing the spill). This product contains 1,6-
Hexanediol diglycidyl ether, which is subject to a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) under the Toxic Substances Control 
Act.  It is believed to be toxic in an aquatic environment.  Releases to water streams are prohibited.  All internal waste 
streams, residues and spills of uncured material must be collected and incinerated.  
 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
HANDLING:  Keep closure tight and container upright to prevent leakage. Avoid skin and eye contact. Wash thoroughly 
after handling. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood. Empty containers should not be re-
used. Use with adequate ventilation. This product contains 1,6-Hexanediol diglycidyl ether, which is subject to a Significant 
New Use Rule (SNUR) under the Toxic Substances Control Act. For additional information, please refer to 40 CFR 
721.5575.   
 
STORAGE:  Store only in well-ventilated areas. Keep container closed when not in use.   
 
INCOMPATIBILITY:  Amines, acids, water, hydroxyl, or active hydrogen compounds.; Strong oxidizers.

Engineering controls:    Sufficient ventilation in pattern and volume should be provided in order to maintain air 
contaminant levels below recommended exposure limits.  
 
PERSONAL PROTECTION MEASURES/EQUIPMENT: 
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION:    Use a NIOSH approved air-purifying organic vapor respirator if occupational 
limits are exceeded.  For emergency situations, confined space use, or other conditions where exposure limits may be 
greatly exceeded, use an approved air-supplied respirator. For respirator use observe OSHA regulations (29CFR 
1910.134) or use in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of your country or particular locality. This

product contains 1,6-Hexanediol diglycidyl ether, which is subject to a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) under the 
Toxic Substances Control Act.  The employer must demonstrate that respiratory protection is provided this includes a 
NIOSH approved respirator to prevent inhalation exposure.  For additional information, please refer to 40 CFR 
721.5575.  
 
SKIN PROTECTION:    Use neoprene, nitrile, or rubber gloves to prevent skin contact. This product contains 1,6-
Hexanediol diglycidyl ether, which is subject to a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) under the Toxic Substances 
Control Act.  The employer must demonstrate that each item of chemical protective clothing selected, including 
gloves, provides an impervious barrier to prevent dermal exposure.  For additional information, please refer to 40 
CFR 721.5575.  
 
EYE PROTECTION:    Use safety eyewear including safety glasses with side shields and chemical goggles where 
splashing may occur.

IF INHALED: Remove to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. 
IF ON SKIN (or hair): Remove/Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with water/shower. 
IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do.

Other Hazards:  
This product contains component(s) which have the following warnings; however based on the GHS classification 
criteria of your country or locale, the product mixture may be outside the respective category(s). 
Acute:  Vapors may cause irritation of nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract. May cause respiratory tract irritation. 
May cause headache and nausea. Eye contact may cause severe eye damage, including vision disturbances, corneal 
damage, and blindness. Dermal absorption possible. 
Chronic:  May cause conjunctivitis or other adverse eye effects. May cause long-term lung damage. IARC has 
designated titanium dioxide (TiO2) as Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic to humans in dust form.  However, a 
number of long term animal studies and human epidemiology studies evaluating TiO2 and workplace exposure show 
insufficient evidence for carcinogenic effects.  EPA, NTP and OSHA do not designate TiO2 as a carcinogen and 
ACGIH designates TiO2 as A4 - not classifiable as a human carcinogen. Mortaility from other chronic diseases, 
including other respiratory diseases, was not associated with exposure to TiO2 dust. TiO2 is not present in this 
product as a dust and no airborne exposure is expected during application. Repeated or prolonged skin contact may 
cause allergic reactions with susceptible persons.

Engineering controls:    Sufficient ventilation in pattern and volume should be provided in order to maintain air 
contaminant levels below recommended exposure limits.  
 
PERSONAL PROTECTION MEASURES/EQUIPMENT: 
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION:    Use a NIOSH approved air-purifying organic vapor respirator if occupational 
limits are exceeded.  For emergency situations, confined space use, or other conditions where exposure limits may be 
greatly exceeded, use an approved air-supplied respirator. For respirator use observe OSHA regulations (29CFR 
1910.134) or use in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of your country or particular locality.  
 
SKIN PROTECTION:    Use neoprene, nitrile, or rubber gloves to prevent skin contact.  
 
EYE PROTECTION:    Use safety eyewear including safety glasses with side shields and chemical goggles where 
splashing may occur.  
 
OTHER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT:    Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse.  
 
HYGIENIC PRACTICES:    Wash hands before eating, smoking, or using toilet facility. Food or beverages should 
not be consumed anywhere this product is handled or stored. Wash thoroughly after handling.
