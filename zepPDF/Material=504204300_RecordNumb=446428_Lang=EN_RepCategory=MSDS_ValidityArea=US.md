1) Precautions for safe
handling
Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if victim ingested the substance; give artificial
respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other
proper respiratory medical device.
-
IF SWALLOWED: Immediately call a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician.
-
Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved and take
precautions to protect themselves.
-
Use alcohol foam, carbon dioxide, or water spray when fighting fires involving this
material.
-
Use dry sand or earth to smother fire.
-
Direct water (Unsuitable extinguishing media)
-
Fire may produce irritating, corrosive and/or toxic gases.
-
Heating may cause a fire or explosion.
-
Rescuers should put on appropriate protective gear.
-
In case of fire: Evacuate area. Fight fire remotely due to the risk of explosion.
-
Eliminate all ignition sources if safe to do so.
-
Clean up spills immediately, observing precautions in Protective Equipment section.
-
ELIMINATE all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate
area).
-
Do not touch damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate
protective clothing.
-
Please note that materials and conditions to be avoided.
-
Large spill: Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.
-
Absorb spill with inert material (e.g., dry sand or earth), then place in a chemical
waste container.
-
Absorb the liquid and scrub the area with detergent and water.
-
Follow all MSDS/label precautions even after container is emptied because they may
retain product residues.
-
Please note that materials and conditions to be avoided.
-
Handling refer to engineering control/personal protection section.
-
Wash thoroughly after handling.
