4 – First Aid Measures 
Ingestion (Swallowed): Aspiration Hazard. DO NOT induce vomiting. Call physician, poison control center or 
the WD-40 Safety Hotline at 1-888-324-7596 immediately. 
Eye Contact: Flush thoroughly with water. Remove contact lenses if present after the first 5 minutes and 
continue flushing for several more minutes. Get medical attention if irritation persists. 
Skin Contact: Wash with soap and water. If irritation develops and persists, get medical attention. 
Inhalation (Breathing): If irritation is experienced, move to fresh air. Get medical attention if irritation or other 
symptoms develop and persist. 
Signs and Symptoms of Exposure: Harmful or fatal if swallowed. Aspiration of liquid into the lungs during 
swallowing or vomiting may cause lung damage. May cause eye and respiratory irritation. Inhalation of mists 
or vapors may cause drowsiness, dizziness and other nervous system effects. Skin contact may cause drying 
of the skin. 
Indication of Immediate Medical Attention/Special Treatment Needed: Immediate medical attention is 
needed for ingestion. 
 
5 – Fire Fighting Measures 
Suitable (and unsuitable) Extinguishing Media: Use water fog, dry chemical, carbon dioxide or foam. Do 
not use water jet or flooding amounts of water. Burning product will float on the surface and spread fire. 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical: Extremely flammable aerosol. Contents under pressure.  
Keep away from ignition sources and open flames. Exposure of containers to extreme heat and flames can 
cause them to rupture often with violent force. Vapors are heavier than air and may travel along surfaces to 
remote ignition sources and flash back. Combustion will produce oxides of carbon and hydrocarbons. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters: Firefighters should always wear positive 
pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing. Cool fire-exposed containers with 
water. Use shielding to protect against bursting containers. 
 
6 – Accidental Release Measures 
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures: Wear appropriate protective 
clothing (see Section 8). Eliminate all sources of ignition and ventilate area.  
Methods and Materials for Containment/Cleanup: Leaking cans should be placed in a plastic bag or open 
pail until the pressure has dissipated. Contain and collect liquid with an inert absorbent and place in a 
container for disposal. Clean spill area thoroughly. Report spills to authorities as required.

7 – Handling and Storage 
Precautions for Safe Handling: Avoid contact with eyes. Avoid prolonged contact with skin. Avoid breathing 
vapors or aerosols. Use only with adequate ventilation. Keep away from heat, sparks, pilot lights, hot surfaces 
and open flames. Unplug electrical tools, motors and appliances before spraying or bringing the can near any 
source of electricity. Electricity can burn a hole in the can and cause contents to burst into flames. To avoid 
serious burn injury, do not let the can touch battery terminals, electrical connections on motors or appliances 
or any other source of electricity. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling. Keep containers 
closed when not in use. Keep out of the reach of children.  Do not puncture, crush or incinerate containers, 
even when empty. 
Conditions for Safe Storage: Store in a cool, well-ventilated area, away from incompatible materials. Do not 
store above 120F or in direct sunlight. U.F.C (NFPA 30B) Level 3 Aerosol. Store away from oxidizers.
