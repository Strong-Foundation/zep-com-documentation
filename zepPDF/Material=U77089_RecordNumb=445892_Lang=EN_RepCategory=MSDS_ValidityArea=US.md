SECTION 4:  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
4.1 Description of First Aid Measures 
 
First-aid measures - general:  Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.  If you feel unwell, seek medical advice 
(show the label where possible). 
 
Inhalation:  Remove the victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing.  Immediately call a poison center 
or doctor/physician/ambulance. 
 
Skin Contact:  Remove/Take off immediately all contaminated clothing.  Rinse skin with water/shower.  Immediately call a poison 
center or doctor/physician/ambulance. 
 
Eye Contact:  Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes.  Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do.  Continue 
rinsing.  Immediately call a doctor/physician/ambulance. 
 
Ingestion:  Rinse mouth.  Do NOT induce vomiting.  Immediately call a poison center or doctor/physician/ambulance.
