SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Precautions for Safe 
Handling: 
Prevent formation of dusts. 
Conditions for Safe 
Storage 
Corrosive to Aluminum.  Keep receptacle tightly sealed.  Protect from heat and direct 
sunlight. 
SECTION 8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION 
Control Parameters 
Components with limit values that require monitoring at the workplace: 
The product does not contain any relevant quantities of materials with critical values that have to be monitored at 
the workplace. 
Additional: the lists that were valid during the creation were used as a basis. 
General protective 
and hygienic 
measures: 
Keep away from foodstuffs, beverages and feed.  Immediately remove all soiled and 
contaminated clothing.  Wash hands before breaks and at the end of work.  Avoid 
contact with the eyes and skin.   
Eye/Face Protection: 
Avoid contact with the eyes and skin.  Use tightly sealed goggles. 
Skin Protection: 
Avoid contact with the eyes and skin. 
Protective Gloves:  Use protective gloves.  The glove material has to be impermeable 
and resistant to the produc.  Due to missing tests, no recommendation to the glove 
material can be given for the product.  Selection of the glove material on consideration 
of the penetration times, rates of diffusion and degradation. 
Material of gloves:  The selection of the suitable gloves does not only depend on the 
material, but also on further marks of quality and varies from manufacturer to 
manufacturer. As the product is a preparation of several substances, the resistance of 
the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked 
prior to the application. 
Penetration time of glove material:  The exact break through time has to be found 
out by the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be observed. 
Respiratory 
Protection: 
In case of brief exposure or low pollution use respiratory filter device. In case of 
intensive or longer exposure use respiratory protective device that is independent of 
circulating air.
