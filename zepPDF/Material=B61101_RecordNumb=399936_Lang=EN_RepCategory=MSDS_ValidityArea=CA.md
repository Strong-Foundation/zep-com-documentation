4. First-aid measures
Move to fresh air. Call a physician if symptoms develop or persist.
Inhalation
Remove contaminated clothing. Wash with plenty of soap and water. If skin irritation occurs: Get
medical advice/attention. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.
Skin contact
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if
present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Get medical attention if irritation develops and persists.
Eye contact
Rinse mouth. If vomiting occurs, keep head low so that stomach content doesn't get into the lungs.

Most important
symptoms/effects, acute and
delayed
Provide general supportive measures and treat symptomatically. Keep victim warm. Keep victim
under observation. Symptoms may be delayed.
Indication of immediate
medical attention and special
treatment needed
Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved, and take precautions to
protect themselves. Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance.
General information
5. Fire-fighting measures
Alcohol resistant foam. Powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2).
Suitable extinguishing media
Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire.
Unsuitable extinguishing
media
Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may explode when exposed to heat or flame.
During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed.
Specific hazards arising from
the chemical
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with
face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA.
Special protective equipment
and precautions for firefighters
Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Containers should be cooled with
water to prevent vapor pressure build up. For massive fire in cargo area, use unmanned hose
holder or monitor nozzles, if possible. If not, withdraw and let fire burn out.
Fire fighting
equipment/instructions
Use standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials. Move
containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. In the event of fire and/or explosion do not
breathe fumes.
Specific methods
Extremely flammable aerosol.
General fire hazards
6. Accidental release measures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Wear
appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Do not touch damaged containers
or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing. Ventilate closed spaces before
entering them. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot be contained. For
personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.
Personal precautions,
protective equipment and
emergency procedures
Refer to attached safety data sheets and/or instructions for use. Stop leak if you can do so without
risk. Move the cylinder to a safe and open area if the leak is irreparable. Use water spray to reduce
vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. Eliminate all ignition
sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Keep combustibles (wood,
paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. Prevent product from entering drains. Cover with plastic
sheet to prevent spreading. Absorb in vermiculite, dry sand or earth and place into containers.
Following product recovery, flush area with water.
Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly to
remove residual contamination. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.

Avoid release to the environment. Inform appropriate managerial or supervisory personnel of all
environmental releases. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid discharge into
drains, water courses or onto the ground.
Environmental precautions
7. Handling and storage
Pressurized container:  Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Do not use if spray button is missing
or defective. Do not spray on a naked flame or any other incandescent material. Do not smoke
while using or until sprayed surface is thoroughly dry. Do not cut, weld, solder, drill, grind, or
expose containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. All equipment used when
handling the product must be grounded. Do not re-use empty containers. Do not taste or swallow.
Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. When using, do not eat, drink or smoke. Use only in
well-ventilated areas. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment. Wash hands thoroughly
after handling. Avoid release to the environment. Observe good industrial hygiene practices.
Precautions for safe handling
Level 2 Aerosol.
Pressurized container. Protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures exceeding
50°C/122 °F. Do not puncture, incinerate or crush. Do not handle or store near an open flame,
heat or other sources of ignition. This material can accumulate static charge which may cause
spark and become an ignition source. Store away from incompatible materials (see Section 10 of
the SDS).
