5.3. Special protective actions for fire-fighters
Water may not effectively extinguish fire; however, it should be used to keep fire-exposed containers and surfaces cool and 
prevent explosive rupture.
SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
6.1. Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Evacuate area.  Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. - No smoking.  Use only non-sparking tools.  Ventilate 
the area with fresh air.  For large spill, or spills in confined spaces, provide mechanical ventilation to disperse or exhaust 
vapors, in accordance with good industrial hygiene practice.  Warning! A motor could be an ignition source and could cause 
flammable gases or vapors in the spill area to burn or explode.  Refer to other sections of this SDS for information regarding 
physical and health hazards, respiratory protection, ventilation, and personal protective equipment.
6.2. Environmental precautions
Avoid release to the environment.
6.3. Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
Contain spill.  Cover spill area with a fire-extinguishing foam.  An appropriate aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) is 
recommended.  Working from around the edges of the spill inward, cover with bentonite, vermiculite, or commercially 
available inorganic absorbent material.  Mix in sufficient absorbent until it appears dry.  Remember, adding an absorbent 
material does not remove a physical, health, or environmental hazard.  Collect as much of the spilled material as possible 
using non-sparking tools.  Place in a metal container approved for transportation by appropriate authorities.  Clean up  residue 
with an appropriate solvent selected by a qualified and authorized person.  Ventilate the area with fresh air. Read and follow 
safety precautions on the solvent label and SDS.  Seal the container.  Dispose of collected material as soon as possible.

7.1. Precautions for safe handling
Keep out of reach of children.  Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood.  Keep away from 
heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. - No smoking.  Use only non-sparking tools.  Take precautionary measures against 
static discharge.  Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray.  Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.  Do not eat, 
drink or smoke when using this product.  Wash thoroughly after handling.  Contaminated work clothing should not be 
allowed out of the workplace.  Avoid release to the environment.  Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.  Avoid contact 
with oxidizing agents (eg. chlorine, chromic acid etc.)  Use personal protective equipment (gloves, respirators, etc.) as 
required.  To minimize the risk of ignition, determine applicable electrical classifications for the process using this product 
and select specific local exhaust ventilation equipment to avoid flammable vapor accumulation.
7.2. Conditions for safe storage including any incompatibilities
Store in a well-ventilated place.  Keep cool.  Keep container tightly closed.  Store away from acids.  Store away from 
oxidizing agents.

8.2. Exposure controls
8.2.1. Engineering controls
Use general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure 
Limits and/or control dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.
8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Eye/face protection
Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment.  The following eye/face
protection(s) are recommended:
Indirect Vented Goggles
Skin/hand protection
Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the 
results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the 
substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. 
Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective 
clothing.  Note: Nitrile gloves may be worn over polymer laminate gloves to improve dexterity.
Gloves made from the following material(s) are recommended:  Polymer laminate
Respiratory protection
An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part of 
a full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following respirator
type(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:
Half facepiece or full facepiece air-purifying respirator suitable for organic vapors and particulates
For questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.

NFPA Hazard Classification
Health:  2  Flammability:  3  Instability:  0  Special Hazards:  None
 
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.
