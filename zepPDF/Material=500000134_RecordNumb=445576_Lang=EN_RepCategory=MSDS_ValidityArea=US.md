Valve protection caps and valve outlet threaded plugs must 
remain in place unless container is secured with valve outlet 
piped to use point. 
Use a check valve or trap in the discharge line to prevent 
hazardous back flow into the cylinder. 
Prevent backflow into the gas tank. 
Use a pressure reducing regulator when connecting cylinder 
to lower pressure (<3000 psig) piping or systems. 
Close valve after each use and when empty. Do NOT change 
or force fit connections. 
Prevent the intrusion of water into the gas tank. 
Never attempt to lift cylinder by its cap. 
Do not drag, slide or roll cylinders. 
Use a suitable hand truck for cylinder movement. 
Keep away from heat and sources of ignition. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Take care to prevent spills, waste and minimize release to the 
environment. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
 
:

Engineering measures 
: 
Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas. 
Minimize workplace exposure concentrations. 
 
Personal protective equipment 
Respiratory protection 
 
: 
General and local exhaust ventilation is recommended to 
maintain vapor exposures below recommended limits. Where 
concentrations are above recommended limits or are 
unknown, appropriate respiratory protection should be worn. 
Follow OSHA respirator regulations (29 CFR 1910.134) and 
use NIOSH/MSHA approved respirators. Protection provided 
by air purifying respirators against exposure to any 
hazardous chemical is limited. Use a positive pressure air 
supplied respirator if there is any potential for uncontrolled 
release, exposure levels are unknown, or any other 
circumstance where air purifying respirators may not provide 
adequate protection. 
 
Hand protection
Material 
: 
Low temperature resistant gloves 
 
 
 
Remarks 
 
: 
Choose gloves to protect hands against chemicals depending 
on the concentration specific to place of work. For special 
applications, we recommend clarifying the resistance to 
chemicals of the aforementioned protective gloves with the 
glove manufacturer. Wash hands before breaks and at the 
end of workday. Breakthrough time is not determined for the 
product. Change gloves often!  
 
Eye protection 
 
: 
Wear the following personal protective equipment: 
Chemical resistant goggles must be worn. 
Face-shield 
 
Skin and body protection 
 
: 
Skin should be washed after contact. 
 
Protective measures 
 
: 
Wear cold insulating gloves/ face shield/ eye protection. 
 
Hygiene measures 
 
: 
Ensure that eye flushing systems and safety showers are 
located close to the working place. 
When using do not eat, drink or smoke. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use.
