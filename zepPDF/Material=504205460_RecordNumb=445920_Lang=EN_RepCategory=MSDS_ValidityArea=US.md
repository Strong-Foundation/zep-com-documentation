minutes. If symptoms develop and persist, get medical attention.  
 
Ingestion: 
Do not induce vomiting. Seek medical advice.  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media: 
Foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.   
 
Special firefighting procedures: 
None  
 
Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
None  
 
Hazardous combustion products: 
Oxides of carbon. Oxides of silicon. Formaldehyde. Toxic and irritating vapors. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and 
unprotected personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Do not allow to enter the ground / soil.  
 
Clean-up methods: 
Do not empty into drains / surface water / ground water. Wipe up using 
absorbent material. Keep in suitable and closed containers for disposal.  
 
7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling:

11.  TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION 
 
Relevant routes of exposure: 
Skin, Inhalation, Eyes, Ingestion 
 
 
Potential Health Effects/Symptoms 
 
Inhalation: 
Inhalation of vapors from uncured sealant may cause respiratory tract irritation. When heated to 
temperatures exceeding 300° F (150° C) in the presence of air, silicones may form 
formaldehyde vapors. Formaldehyde is a potential cancer hazard and a known skin and 
respiratory sensitizer.  Vapors irritate the eyes, nose and throat. Safe handling conditions may 
be maintained by keeping formaldehyde vapor concentrations below the OSHA permissible 
limit. 
Skin contact: 
May cause skin irritation. May cause allergic skin reaction. 
Eye contact: 
Causes serious eye irritation.  
Ingestion: 
Not expected under normal conditions of use. May be harmful if swallowed.
