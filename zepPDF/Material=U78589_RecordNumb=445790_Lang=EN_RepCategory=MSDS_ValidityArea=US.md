First Aid Measures  
 
General Advice  
Provide this SDS to medical personnel for treatment.  
Eye Contact  
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for 15 minutes. Get medical attention, if irritation persists 
Skin Contact  
Extended contact may cause irritation or defatting. Flush skin with water for 15 minutes. Get medical attention for any 
irritation that persists 
Inhalation  
Remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Get immediate 
medical attention. If unconscious, place in recovery position and get medical attention immediately. Maintain an open 
airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt, or waistband. 
Ingestion

Not determined 
Specific Hazards Arising 
from the Chemical  
Product is not combustible or an explosive. 
Protective equipment and 
precautions for firefighters  
 
Promptly remove all persons from the vicinity of the incident if there is a fire. Move containers 
from fire area if this can be done without risk. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers 
cool. In the event of a fire, wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self-contained 
breathing apparatus with full face piece operated in the pressure demand or other positive 
pressure mode. Increases the flammability of combustible, organic and readily oxidizable 
materials.

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures  
 
Personal 
Precautions  
Wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection. 
 
Environmental 
Precautions  
 
Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with waterways, drains and sewers. Inform the 
relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental pollution (sewers or waterways). 
GENERAL PROCEDURES: Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains, and 
sewers. Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental pollution (sewers, waterways, soil,

Methods and material for containment and cleaning up  
 
Methods for 
Containment  
 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so.  
Methods for 
Clean-Up  
SMALL SPILL: Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Dilute with water and mop if water-soluble. 
Alternately, or if water-soluble, absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste disposal 
container. Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor. 
LARGE SPILL: Dike area to contain spill. Wash the spill site with water. See section 13, Disposal Considerations, for 
additional 
information. 
 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Precautions for safe handling  
 
Advice on Safe 
Handling  
Use only in a well ventilated area.
