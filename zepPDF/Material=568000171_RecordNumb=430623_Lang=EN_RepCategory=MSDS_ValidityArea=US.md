SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If on skin, rinse well with water. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Flush eyes with water as a precaution. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Do NOT induce vomiting. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Chronic effects are delayed and symptoms may not be 
observed during an exposure.
