General information
5. Fire-fighting measures
Alcohol resistant foam. Powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2).
Suitable extinguishing media
Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire.
Unsuitable extinguishing
media
Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may explode when exposed to heat or flame.
During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed.
Specific hazards arising from
the chemical
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with
face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA.
Special protective equipment
and precautions for firefighters
Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Containers should be cooled with
water to prevent vapor pressure build up. For massive fire in cargo area, use unmanned hose
holder or monitor nozzles, if possible. If not, withdraw and let fire burn out.
Fire fighting
equipment/instructions
Use standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials. Move
containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. In the event of fire and/or explosion do not
breathe fumes.
Specific methods
Extremely flammable aerosol.
General fire hazards
6. Accidental release measures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Wear
appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Avoid breathing gas. Do not touch
damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing. Ventilate
closed spaces before entering them. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages
cannot be contained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.

Refer to attached safety data sheets and/or instructions for use. Stop leak if you can do so without
risk. Move the cylinder to a safe and open area if the leak is irreparable. Isolate area until gas has
dispersed. Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area).
Keep combustibles (wood, paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. Prevent product from
entering drains. Cover with plastic sheet to prevent spreading. Absorb in vermiculite, dry sand or
earth and place into containers. Following product recovery, flush area with water.
Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly to
remove residual contamination. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.
Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up
Avoid release to the environment. Inform appropriate managerial or supervisory personnel of all
environmental releases. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid discharge into
drains, water courses or onto the ground.
Environmental precautions
7. Handling and storage
Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read
and understood. Pressurized container:  Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Do not use if spray
button is missing or defective. Do not spray on a naked flame or any other incandescent material.
Do not smoke while using or until sprayed surface is thoroughly dry. Do not cut, weld, solder, drill,
grind, or expose containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. All equipment used
when handling the product must be grounded. Do not re-use empty containers. Avoid breathing
gas. Avoid contact with eyes. Pregnant or breastfeeding women must not handle this product.
Should be handled in closed systems, if possible. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Wear
appropriate personal protective equipment. Avoid release to the environment. Observe good
industrial hygiene practices.
Precautions for safe handling
Level 2 Aerosol.
Store locked up. Pressurized container. Protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures
exceeding 50°C/122 °F. Do not puncture, incinerate or crush. Do not handle or store near an open
flame, heat or other sources of ignition. This material can accumulate static charge which may
cause spark and become an ignition source. Store away from incompatible materials (see Section
10 of the SDS).

Good general ventilation (typically 10 air changes per hour) should be used. Ventilation rates
should be matched to conditions. If applicable, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation,
or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below recommended exposure limits. If
exposure limits have not been established, maintain airborne levels to an acceptable level. Provide
eyewash station.
