SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids,

Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Bromine compounds 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters 
: Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if 
necessary. 
 
 
SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to 
local / national regulations (see section 13). 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Technical measures 
: This product has no measured flash point and is non-
flammable per OSHA, CPSC, and DOT regulations. However, 
the vapors of this product will form a flammable mixture in a 
narrow concentration range of 4.6 % to 8.5 % by volume in air 
based on n-propyl bromide. Do not weld or cut any drum with 
a torch that contains this product because residual vapors in 
the drum could be in the flammable range and an explosion 
could occur. 
 
 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Avoid formation of aerosol. 
Do not breathe vapours or spray mist.

For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: No smoking. 
Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated 
place. 
Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and 
kept upright to prevent leakage. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Keep away from oxidizing agents and strongly acid or alkaline 
materials.

Transportation Notes 
This product does not have a flashpoint that can be measured, therefore this product does not meet 
the criteria as a flammable liquid under the regulations of the US DOT special provisions (CFR 
172.101 (c)(12)(iv)) and Canadian TDG (SOR/2017-137, 2.18 (1)(a)), and does not meet the definition 
of any other hazard class.  Based on this information and conventions used by our supplier(s), this 
product is not regulated for transport in the United States and Canada.  As noted above, a transport 
classification of UN2344 - Bromopropanes, should be used for shipments by air (IATA) or by sea 
(IMDG). 
 
The product as delivered to the customer conforms to packaging requirements for shipment by road 
under US Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. Additional transportation classifications 
noted above are for reference only, and not a certification or warranty of the suitability of the packaging 
for shipment under these alternative transport regulations.
