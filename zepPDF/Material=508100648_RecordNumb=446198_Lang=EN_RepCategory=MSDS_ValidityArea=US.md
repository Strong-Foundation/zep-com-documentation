4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Inhalation: 
Move to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is 
difficult, give oxygen. Get medical attention.  
 
Skin contact: 
Immediately flush skin with plenty of water (using soap, if available). Remove 
contaminated clothing and footwear. Wash clothing before reuse. Get medical 
attention.  
 
Eye contact: 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. Get medical attention.  
 
Ingestion: 
Do not induce vomiting. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious 
person. Get medical attention.  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media: 
Water spray (fog), foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.   
 
Special firefighting procedures: 
Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing, such as 
turn-out gear.  
 
Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
Uncontrolled polymerization may occur at high temperatures resulting in 
explosions or rupture of storage containers.  
 
Hazardous combustion products: 
Oxides of nitrogen. Oxides of carbon. Irritating organic vapours. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected 
personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Do not allow product to enter sewer or waterways.  
 
Clean-up methods: 
Remove all sources of ignition. Evacuate and ventilate spill area; dike spill to 
prevent entry into water system; wear full protective equipment during clean-
up. Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, 
universal binder, sawdust). Scrape up as much material as possible. Store in a 
partly filled, closed container until disposal. Refer to Section 8 "Exposure 
Controls / Personal Protection" prior to clean up.
