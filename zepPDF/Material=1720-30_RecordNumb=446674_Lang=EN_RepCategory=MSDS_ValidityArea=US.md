SECTION 4: FIRST-AID MEASURES
4.1
Description of necessary measures:
The symptoms resulting from intoxication can appear after exposure, therefore, in case of doubt, seek medical attention for direct
exposure to the chemical product or persistent discomfort, showing the SDS of this product.
By inhalation:
This product does not contain substances classified as hazardous for inhalation, however, in case of symptoms of intoxication
remove the person affected from the exposure area and provide with fresh air. Seek medical attention if the symptoms get worse
or persist.
By skin contact:
In case of contact it is recommended to clean the affected area thoroughly with water and neutral soap. In case of modifications
on the skin (stinging, redness, rashes, blisters,…), seek medical advice with this Safety data Sheet
By eye contact:
This product does not contain substances classified as hazardous for eye contact. Rinse eyes thoroughly for at least 15 minutes
with lukewarm water, ensuring that the person affected does not rub or close their eyes.
By ingestion/aspiration:
Request medical assistance immediately, showing the SDS of this product. Do not induce vomiting, but if it does happen keep the
head down to avoid aspiration. In the case of loss of consciousness do not administrate anything orally unless supervised by a
doctor. Rinse out the mouth and throat, as they may have been affected during ingestion. Keep the person affected at rest.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES
5.1
Suitable (and unsuitable) extinguishing media:
Product is non-flammable under normal conditions of storage, manipulation and use. In the case of inflammation as a result of
improper manipulation, storage or use preferably use polyvalent powder extinguishers (ABC powder), in accordance with the
Regulation on fire protection systems. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED to use tap water as an extinguishing agent.
5.2
Specific hazards arising from the chemical:
As a result of combustion or thermal decomposition reactive sub-products are created that can become highly toxic and,
consequently, can present a serious health risk.
5.3
Special protective equipment and precautions for fire-fighters:
Depending on the magnitude of the fire it may be necessary to use full protective clothing and individual respiratory equipment.
Minimum emergency facilities and equipment should be available (fire blankets, portable first aid kit,...)
Additional provisions:
As in any fire, prevent human exposure to fire, smoke, fumes or products of combustion. Only properly trained personnel should
be involved in firefighting. Evacuate nonessential personnel from the fire area. Destroy any source of ignition. In case of fire,
refrigerate the storage containers and tanks for products susceptible to inflammation. Avoid spillage of the products used to
extinguish the fire into an aqueous medium.
