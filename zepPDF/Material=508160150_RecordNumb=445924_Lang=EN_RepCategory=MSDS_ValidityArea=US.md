material does not remove a physical, health, or environmental hazard.  Collect as much of the spilled material as possible.  
Place in a closed container approved for transportation by appropriate authorities.  Clean up residue with detergent and 
water.  Seal the container.  Dispose of collected material as soon as possible in accordance with applicable 
local/regional/national/international regulations.

Occupational exposure limits
No occupational exposure limit values exist for any of the components listed in Section 3 of this SDS.
8.2. Exposure controls
8.2.1. Engineering controls
Provide appropriate local exhaust ventilation for sanding, grinding or machining.  Use general dilution ventilation and/or 
local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control 
dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.
8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Eye/face protection
Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment.  The following eye/face 
protection(s) are recommended:
Safety Glasses with side shields
Skin/hand protection
No chemical protective gloves are required.
 
Respiratory protection
An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part 
of a full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following 
respirator type(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:
Half facepiece or full facepiece air-purifying respirator suitable for organic vapors and particulates
For questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.
