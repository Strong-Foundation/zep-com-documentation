Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: None. 
Specific hazards in case of fire:  Decomposes on heating and can release formaldehyde. 
Avoid reaction with oxidizers. 
Special protective equipment and precautions for fire fighters: 
 
No acute hazard.  Move container from fire area, if possible.  Avoid breathing vapors or 
dusts.  Keep upwind.  Use full firefighting gear (bunker gear).  Any supplied-air respirator with full 
face piece and operated in a pressure-demand or other positive pressure mode in combination 
with a separate escape air supply.  Use any self contained breathing apparatus with a full face 
piece. 
 
Alert fire brigade and indicate hazard location.  Wear breathing apparatus plus protective 
clothing.  Cool fire exposed containers with water spray from a protected location.  Do not 
approach containers suspected to be hot.  If safe to do so, remove containers from path of fire. 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
Personal precautions:  Use appropriate personal protection.  (See section 8.) 
Environmental precautions:  For larger spills, cover drains and build dikes to prevent entry into 
sewer systems or bodies of water.  Collect the resulting residue containing solution.  Place in a 
metal container approved for transportation by appropriate authorities.  Dispose of collected 
material as soon as possible. 
Methods for material containment and cleaning up:  Observe precautions from other sections.  
Contain spill. Working from around the edges of the spill inward, cover with bentonite, vermiculite, 
or commercially available inorganic absorbent material.  Mix in sufficient absorbent until it appears 
dry.  Collect as much of the spilled material as possible.  Clean up residue with an appropriate 
solvent.  Seal the container. 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Precautions for safe handling: Avoid contact with skin, inhalation of mist, or ingestion.  See 
section 8 for personal protection equipment.  Practice good personal hygiene to 
prevent accidental ingestion after handling.  Properly dispose of clothing that 
cannot be decontaminated.   
Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities: Store away from oxidizing 
materials.  Store product in a closed container located in a dry area.  Do not store 
in open, inadequate, or mislabeled packaging.  Check that containers are clearly 
labeled.  Use metal cans, metal drums, plastic, or lined fiber containers.  Keep 
away from heat and flame. 
8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION 
Control Parameters:  Under most handling conditions, this product will not generate mist or dust.     
Engineering Controls:  In most conditions, no special local ventilation is needed.  General 
ventilation recommended.  If the product is heated above 150°C or atomized ventilation should be 
used. 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): 
Eyes:   
Safety glasses recommended. 
Skin: 
Impermeable gloves should be worn.  Product is compatible with most 
elastomers.  
Inhalation: 
No respiratory protection required under most conditions.  If concentrations 
exceed exposure limits, approved respiratory equipment must be used.

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency 
personnel to address the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to material 
under conditions of fire, spill, or similar emergencies.  Hazard ratings are primarily based on 
inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include the toxic properties of 
combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.

Hazardous Material Identification System (HMIS) hazard ratings are designed to inform 
employees of chemical hazards in the workplace. The ratings are based on inherent properties of 
the material under expected conditions of normal use and are not intended for use in emergency 
situations. 
 
These data are offered in good faith as typical values and not as product specifications. No
