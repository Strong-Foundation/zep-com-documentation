8.2.       Exposure Controls 
Appropriate Engineering Controls: Emergency eye wash fountain capability should be available in the immediate vicinity of any 
potential exposure. Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas. Ensure all national/local regulations are observed. 
Proper grounding procedures to avoid static electricity should be followed. Use explosion-proof equipment. Use local exhaust or 
general dilution ventilation or other suppression methods to maintain dust levels below exposure limits. Power equipment should 
be equipped with proper dust collection devices. It is recommended that all dust control equipment such as local exhaust ventilation 
and material transport systems involved in handling of this product contain explosion relief vents or an explosion suppression 
system or an oxygen-deficient environment.
 
Personal Protective Equipment: Gloves. Protective clothing. Protective goggles. Insufficient ventilation: wear respiratory protection. 
 
 
 
 
Materials for Protective Clothing: Chemically resistant materials and fabrics. 
 
Hand Protection: Wear protective gloves. 
 
Eye Protection: Chemical safety goggles. 
 
Skin and Body Protection: Wear suitable protective clothing.
 
Respiratory Protection: If exposure limits are exceeded or irritation is experienced, approved respiratory protection should be worn. 
In case of inadequate ventilation, oxygen deficient atmosphere, or where exposure levels are not known wear approved respiratory 
protection. 
 
Other Information: When using, do not eat, drink or smoke
