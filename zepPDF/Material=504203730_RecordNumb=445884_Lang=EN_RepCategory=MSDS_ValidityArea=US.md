SECTION 4: First aid measures
4.1. Description of first aid measures
Inhalation:
Remove person to fresh air.  If you feel unwell, get medical attention.
Skin Contact:
 Immediately wash with soap and water.  Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse.  If signs/symptoms develop, get 
medical attention.
Eye Contact:
 Immediately flush with large amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.  Remove contact lenses if easy to do.  Continue rinsing.  
Immediately get medical attention.
If Swallowed:
Rinse mouth.  If you feel unwell, get medical attention.
4.2. Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
Allergic skin reaction (redness, swelling, blistering, and itching). Serious damage to the eyes (corneal cloudiness, severe pain, tearing, 
ulcerations, and significantly impaired or loss of vision). Target organ effects following prolonged or repeated exposure.  See Section 11 
for additional details.
4.3. Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment required
Not applicable
SECTION 5: Fire-fighting measures
5.1. Suitable extinguishing media
In case of fire: Use a fire fighting agent suitable for ordinary combustible material such as water or foam to extinguish.

SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
6.1. Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Evacuate area.  Ventilate the area with fresh air.  For large spill, or spills in confined spaces, provide mechanical ventilation 
to disperse or exhaust vapors, in accordance with good industrial hygiene practice.  Refer to other sections of this SDS for 
information regarding physical and health hazards, respiratory protection, ventilation, and personal protective equipment.

6.2. Environmental precautions
Avoid release to the environment.
6.3. Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
Working from around the edges of the spill inward, cover with bentonite, vermiculite, or commercially available inorganic 
absorbent material.  Mix in sufficient absorbent until it appears dry.  Remember, adding an absorbent material does not 
remove a physical, health, or environmental hazard.  Collect as much of the spilled material as possible.  Place in a closed 
container approved for transportation by appropriate authorities.  Clean up  residue with an appropriate solvent selected by 
a qualified and authorized person.  Ventilate the area with fresh air. Read and follow safety precautions on the solvent label 
and SDS.  Seal the container.  Dispose of collected material as soon as possible in accordance with applicable 
local/regional/national/international regulations.

read and understood.  Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray.  Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.  Do 
not eat, drink or smoke when using this product.  Wash thoroughly after handling.  Contaminated work clothing should not 
be allowed out of the workplace.  Avoid release to the environment.  Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.  Avoid 
contact with oxidizing agents (eg. chlorine, chromic acid etc.)  Use personal protective equipment (gloves, respirators, etc.) 
as required.

Eye/face protection
Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment.  The following eye/face 
protection(s) are recommended:
Full Face Shield
Indirect Vented Goggles
Skin/hand protection
Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the 
results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the 
substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. 
Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective 
clothing.  Note: Nitrile gloves may be worn over polymer laminate gloves to improve dexterity.
Gloves made from the following material(s) are recommended: Polymer laminate
If this product is used in a manner that presents a higher potential for exposure (eg. spraying, high splash potential etc.), then 
use of protective coveralls may be necessary.  Select and use body protection to prevent contact based on the results of an 
exposure assessment.  The following protective clothing material(s) are recommended: Apron - polymer laminate
Respiratory protection
An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part 
of a full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following 
respirator type(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:
Half facepiece or full facepiece air-purifying respirator suitable for organic vapors and particulates
For questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.
