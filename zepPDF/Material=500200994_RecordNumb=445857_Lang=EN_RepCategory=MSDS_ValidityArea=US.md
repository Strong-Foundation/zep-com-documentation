4.  FIRST AID MEASURES
EYES: Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Do not attempt to pull apart bonded eyelid.
Seek medical attention.
SKIN: Do not remove by force: while immersed in warm water gently rub affected skin with soap for at least 15 min then
remove if possible without force. Get medical attention if irritation or ill effect develops or persist.
INGESTION: Do not induce vomiting. Saliva will cause cyanoacrylate to polymerize in mouth. If lips are bonded together,
use warm water to gently separate the lips apart. Contact a physician.
INHALATION: Remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration or give oxygen by trained personnel. If
signs or symptoms persist, seek medical attention.
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF OVEREXPOSURE
CHRONIC EFFECTS: Repeated use may result in irritation of mucus membrane and upper respiratory tract.
NOTES TO PHYSICIAN: Cured adhesive does not pose a health risk.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Skin, lips, eyelids or other body parts bonded by cyanoacrylate are best separated by
passive nonsurgical first aid. Generally warm water and gentle manipulation will break the cyanoacrylate bond.
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
FLAMMABLE CLASS: Combustible liquid
GENERAL HAZARD: This product is combustible.
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA: SMALL FIRE: Use DRY chemical powder.
LARGE FIRE: Use foam, fog or water spray. Do not use water jet.
EXPLOSION HAZARDS: None known.
FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES: As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus pressure-demand,
(MSHA/NIOSH approved or equivalent) and full protective gear.
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
 
TOYOTA SUPER CEMENT

SMALL SPILL: Absorb with dry sand, soil, sawdust, cloth, etc., then place in a sealable container.
LARGE SPILL: Dike and prevent overflow. Guide to a safe place then dispose properly.
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS
WATER SPILL: Do not allow product to flow into rivers or affect the environment
RELEASE NOTES: Keep spilled material from entering storm drains, sewers, or other environmental mediums.
COMMENTS: Disposal of clean-up materials may be governmentally regulated. Observe all applicable local, state, and
federal waste management regulations.
7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE
GENERAL PROCEDURES: Avoid handling or clean-up of cyanoacrylate adhesive with cellulose fibers, such as cloth
gloves, rags, paper towels, or clothing. A reaction containing cellulose fibers can cause smoke and fumes.
HANDLING: To avoid fire, minimize ignition sources. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. In case of insufficient
ventilation, wear suitable respiratory equipment. May react in presence of moisture. May react or be incompatible with
alkalies. Wash thoroughly after handling.
STORAGE: Store in well-ventilated place. keep container tightly sealed.
COMMENTS: Rapid polymerization occurs upon contact with water or alkaline substances. As a result, heat is generated.
Skin inflammation or burns may occur upon contact during this polymerization.
