-
Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk.
-
Fire involving Tanks: Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after
fire is out.
-
Fire involving Tanks: Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting
safety devices or discoloration of tank.
-
Fire involving Tanks: ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire.
-
Do not touch or walk through spilled material.
-
ELIMINATE all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate
area).

:
oral; rat(male/female); 91 days; 0, 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day; The subchronic

in the pups. (CESAR)
:
oral; rat(male/female); 0, 200, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day; 29 days; The test
compound did not cause any toxicologically significant or treatment-related
results. Therefore, the NOAEL is 1000 mg/kg/day. (OECD TG 407, GLP) (ECHA)
:
oral; rat(male/female); 28 days; Under the experimental conditions of this study,
the test substance given to rats at the dose levels of 0, 20, 60 and 200
mg/kg/day did not induce any clinical change. The mortality in the 20
mg/kg/day group (one animal out of ten) cannot be certainly related to the
treatment. In laboratory investigations, the slight changes observed at the two
higher dose levels have no toxicological significance. At necropsy, drug-related
signs were seen in the higher dose group. The NOEL was estimated to be 60
