4. First Aid Measures 
 
INHALATION:  Remove the victim to fresh air. If breathing has stopped administer artificial respiration. If breathing is 
difficult, have medical personnel administer oxygen. Get medical attention. 
 
SKIN CONTACT:  Remove contaminated clothing. Immediately wash contacted area thoroughly with soap and water. If 
irritation persists, get medical attention. 
 
EYE CONTACT:  Immediately flush eyes with large amounts of water for 15 minutes. Get medical attention if irritation 
persists. 
 
INGESTION:  Seek immediate medical attention. Immediately call local poison control center or go to an emergency 
department. Never give anything by mouth to or induce vomiting in an unconscious or drowsy person. 
 
MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS: May cause eye irritation. Inhalation of mists may cause nose and throat irritation and 
nervous system effects. Ingestion may cause abdominal discomfort or pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise, 
blurring of vision, irritability, back pain, decrease in urine output, kidney failure, and central nervous system effects. 
 
INDICATION OF IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION AND SPECIAL TREATMENT, IF NEEDED:  Seek immediate 
medical attention for large ingestions. 
 
NOTES TO PHYSICIAN:  The principal toxic effects of ethylene glycol, when swallowed, are kidney damage and metabolic 
acidosis.  The combination of metabolic acidosis, an osmol gap and oxalate crystals in the urine is evidence of ethylene glycol 
poisoning. Pulmonary edema with hypoxemia has been described in a number of patients following poisoning with ethylene 
glycol.  Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation may be required. There may be cranial nerve involvement in the late 
stages of toxicity from swallowed ethylene glycol.  In particular, effects have been reported involving the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth cranial nerves, presenting with bilateral facial paralysis, diminished hearing and dysphagia. 
 
Ethanol is antidotal and its early administration may block the formation of nephrotoxic metabolites of ethylene glycol in the 
liver.  The objective is to rapidly achieve and maintain a blood ethanol level of approximately 100 mg/dl by giving a loading 
dose of ethanol followed by a maintenance dose.  Intravenous administration of ethanol is the preferred route.  Ethanol blood 
levels should be checked frequently. Hemodialysis may be required. 4-Methyl pyrazole (Fomepizole®), a potent inhibitor of 
alcohol dehydrogenase, has been used therapeutically to decrease the metabolic consequences of ethylene glycol poisoning.  
Fomepizole® is easier to use clinically than ethanol, does not cause CNS depression or hypoglycemia and requires less 
monitoring than ethanol. Additional therapeutic modalities which may decrease the adverse consequences of ethylene glycol 
metabolism are the administration of both thiamine and pyridoxine.  As there are complicated and serious overdoses, we 
recommend you consult with the toxicologists at your poison control center.

protective clothing and equipment (See Section 8).   
 
METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR CONTAINMENT/CLEANUP: Collect with absorbent material and place in appropriate, 
labeled container for disposal or, if permitted flush spill area with water. 
 
7. Handling and Storage 
 
PRECAUTIONS FOR SAFE HANDLING:  
 
Harmful or Fatal if Swallowed. Do not drink antifreeze or solution. Avoid eye and prolonged or repeated skin contact. Avoid 
breathing vapors or mists. Wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water after use. Keep container away from open 
flames and excessive heat. Do not reuse empty containers unless properly cleaned. Empty containers retain product residue and 
may be dangerous.  Do not cut, weld, drill, etc. containers, even empty. 
 
Sudden release of hot organic chemical vapors or mists from process equipment operating at elevated temperature and 
pressure, or sudden ingress of air into vacuum equipment, may result in ignitions without any obvious ignition sources. 
Published "autoignition" or "ignition" temperatures cannot be treated as safe operating temperatures in chemical processes 
without analysis of the actual process conditions.  Use of this product in elevated temperature applications should be 
thoroughly evaluated to assure safe operating conditions. 
 
CONDITIONS FOR SAFE STORAGE, INCLUDING ANY INCOMPATIBILITIES:  Do not store in opened or unlabeled 
containers. Store away from excessive heat and oxidizers.

SKIN CONTACT: No evidence of adverse effects from available information. 
 
EYE CONTACT: Liquid, vapors or mist may cause discomfort in the eye with persistent conjunctivitis, seen as slight excess 
redness or conjunctiva.  Serious corneal injury is not anticipated. 
 
INGESTION:  May cause abdominal discomfort or pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise, blurring of vision, 
irritability, back pain, decrease in urine output, kidney failure, and central nervous system effects, including irregular eye 
movements, convulsions and coma.  Cardiac failure and pulmonary edema may develop.  Severe kidney damage which may be 
fatal may follow the swallowing of ethylene glycol.  A few reports have been published describing the development of 
weakness of the facial muscles, diminishing hearing, and difficulty with swallowing, during the late stages of severe poisoning. 
 
CHRONIC EFFECTS:  Prolonged or repeated inhalation exposure may produce signs of central nervous system involvement, 
particularly dizziness and jerking eye movements.  Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause skin sensitization and an 
associated dermatitis in some individuals.  Ethylene glycol has been found to cause birth defects in laboratory animals. The 
significance of this finding to humans has not been determined.  2-Ethyl Hexanoic Acid, Sodium Salt is suspected of causing 
developmental effects based on animal data. 
 
CARCINOGENICITY LISTING:  None of the components of these products is listed as a carcinogen or suspected carcinogen 
by IARC, NTP, ACGIH, or OSHA.

SIGNIFICANT LABORATORY DATA WITH POSSIBLE RELEVANCE TO HUMAN HEALTH: 
Ethylene glycol has been shown to produce dose-related teratogenic effects in rats and mice when given by gavage or in 
drinking water at high concentrations or doses.  Also, in a preliminary study to assess the effects of exposure of pregnant rats 
and mice to aerosols at concentrations 150, 1,000 and 2,500 mg/m3 for 6 hours a day throughout the period of organogenesis, 
teratogenic effects were produced at the highest concentrations, but only in mice.  The conditions of these latter experiments 
did not allow a conclusion as to whether the developmental toxicity was mediated by inhalation of aerosol, percutaneous 
absorption of ethylene glycol from contaminated skin, or swallowing of ethylene glycol as a result of grooming the wetted 
coat.  In a further study, comparing effects from high aerosol concentration by whole-body or nose-only exposure, it was 
shown that nose-only exposure resulted in maternal toxicity (1,000 and 2,500 mg/m3) and developmental toxicity in with 
minimal evidence of teratogenicity (2,500 mg/m3).  The no-effects concentration (based on maternal toxicity) was 500 mg/m3.  
In a further study in mice, no teratogenic effects could be produced when ethylene glycol was applied to the skin of pregnant 
mice over the period of organogenesis.  The above observations suggest that ethylene glycol is to be regarded as an animal 
teratogen; there is currently no available information to suggest that ethylene glycol caused birth defects in humans.  Cutaneous 
application of ethylene glycol is ineffective in producing developmental toxicity; exposure to high aerosol concentration is only 
minimally effective in producing developmental toxicity; the major route for producing developmental toxicity is perorally. 
 
Two chronic feeding studies, using rats and mice, have not produced any evidence that ethylene glycol causes dose-related 
increases in tumor incidence or a different pattern of tumors compared with untreated controls.  The absence of carcinogenic 
potential for ethylene glycol has been supported by numerous invitro genotoxicity studies showing that it does not produce 
mutagenic or clastogenic effects. 
 
In a study of Wistar rats, adverse developmental results were reported at a dose of 100 mg / kg of body weight for 2-Ethyl 
Hexanoic Acid, Sodium Salt. 
 
This product contains less than 0.1% tolytriazole which has demonstrates mutagenic activity in a bacterial test system. A 
correlation has been established between mutagenic activity and carcinogenic activity for many chemicals. Tolytriazole has not 
been identified as a carcinogen or probable carcinogen by NTP, IARC, ACGIH or OSHA.
