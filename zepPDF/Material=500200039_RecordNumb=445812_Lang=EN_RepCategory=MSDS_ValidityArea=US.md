General Advice
If symptoms persist, call a physician. Take a copy of the Safety Data Sheet when going for
medical treatment.
Eye Contact
Immediately flush with plenty of water.  After initial flushing, remove any contact lenses and
continue flushing for at least 15 minutes. Keep eye wide open while rinsing. If eye irritation
persists, consult a specialist.
Skin Contact
Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water while removing all contaminated
clothes and shoes. If skin irritation persists, call a physician.
Inhalation
Move to fresh air in case of accidental inhalation of vapors. If breathing is difficult, give
oxygen. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. Call a physician immediately.
Ingestion
Do not induce vomiting without medical advice. If vomiting occurs naturally, have casualty
lean forward to reduce the risk of aspiration. Call a physician or Poison Control Center
immediately.
Protection of First-aiders
Use personal protective equipment. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing.
4.2  Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed  
Symptoms
No information available.
4.3  Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed  
Notes to Physician
Treat symptomatically.
5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES
Flammable Properties
NFPA: Class IIIB Combustible Liquid
5.1  Suitable Extinguishing Media 
Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local
circumstances and the surrounding environment
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media
Do not use a solid water stream as it may scatter and spread fire.
5.2 Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical 
Keep product and empty container away from heat and sources
of ignition.
Hazardous combustion products:
During a fire, smoke may contain the original material in addition
to combustion products of varying composition which may be
toxic and / or irritating.  Combustion products may include and
are not limited to, Carbon oxides, Hydrogen Sulfide, Oxides of
Magnesium, Nitrogen oxides (NOx), Oxides of Phosphorus,
Sulphur oxides, Zinc oxides.
5.3 Protective Equipment and Precautions for Firefighters 
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus
pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent) and
full protective gear.
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
6.1  Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures  
Personal precautions
Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Avoid breathing vapors or mists. Use personal
protective equipment. Ensure adequate ventilation. Remove all sources of ignition.
6.2  Environmental Precautions

Environmental Precautions
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Prevent product from entering drains. Do
not allow material to contaminate ground water system. Do not flush into surface water or
sanitary sewer system. Large Spills: Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and
disposal. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.
6.3  Methods and material for containment and cleaning up  
Methods for Clean-up
Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth,
diatomaceus earth, vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to local /
national regulations (see section 13).
Spill Management  
LARGE SPILLS
Eliminate sources of ignition.  Prevent additional discharge of material if possible to do so
without hazard.  For small spills implement cleanup procedures; for large spills implement
cleanup procedures and, if in public area, keep public away and advise authorities.  Also, if
this product is subject to CERCLA reporting (see Section 15 Regulatory Information) notify
the National Response Center.
WATER SPILLS
Prevent liquid entering sewers, watercourses, or low areas.  Contain spilled liquid with sand
or earth.  Recover by pumping or with suitable absorbent.  If liquid is too viscous for
pumping, scrape up.  Consult an expert on disposal of recovered material and ensure
conformity to local disposal regulations.
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1. Precautions for safe handling 
Handling
Do not breathe vapors or spray mist. Avoid contact with skin,
eyes and clothing. Wear personal protective equipment. Remove
and wash contaminated clothing before re-use. Keep away from
open flames, hot surfaces and sources of ignition. Take
necessary action to avoid static electricity discharge (which might
cause ignition of organic vapors).
Safe Handling Advice
Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety
practices.
7.2. Conditions for safe storage, including any 
incompatibilities 
Storage
Keep in properly labeled containers. Keep container tightly closed
in a dry and well-ventilated place.
Incompatible Materials and/or Coatings

8.2 Exposure controls  
Appropriate engineering controls 
Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas. Consider the potential hazards of
this material (see Section 2), applicable exposure limits, job activities, and other substances
in the work place when designing engineering controls and selecting personal protective
equipment.  If engineering controls or work practices are not adequate to prevent exposure
to harmful levels of this material, the personal protective equipment listed below is
recommended.  The user should read and understand all instructions and limitations
supplied with the equipment since protection is usually provided for a limited time or under
certain circumstances.
Personal Protective Equipment 
Eye/face protection
Safety glasses equipped with side shields are recommended as minimum protection in
industrial settings. If splashes are likely to occur wear tight fitting safety goggles and/or
face-shield.
Skin protection
Wear protective gloves/clothing. Use clean protective clothing if splashing or spraying
conditions are present. Protective clothing may include long-sleeve outer garment, apron, or
lab coat.  Glove Type:  Neoprene, Nitriles
Respiratory protection
If exposure limits are exceeded or irritation is experienced, NIOSH/MSHA approved
respiratory protection should be worn.  Positive-pressure supplied air respirators may be
required for high airborne contaminant concentrations.  Respiratory protection must be
provided in accordance with current local regulations.
General Hygiene Considerations
When using, do not eat, drink or smoke. Clean equipment, work area and clothing regularly.
