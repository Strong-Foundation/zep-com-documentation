General fire hazards 
Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. Call a POISON 
CENTER or doctor/physician if you feel unwell. 
Remove contaminated clothing. Wash with plenty of soap and water. If skin irritation occurs: Get 
medical advice/attention. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
Rinse with water. Get medical attention if irritation develops and persists. 
Call a physician or poison control center immediately. Rinse mouth. Do not induce vomiting. If 
vomiting occurs, keep head low so that stomach content doesn't get into the lungs. 
Aspiration may cause pulmonary edema and pneumonitis. May cause drowsiness and dizziness. 
Headache. Nausea, vomiting. Skin irritation. May cause redness and pain. 
 
 
Provide general supportive measures and treat symptomatically. Keep victim under observation. 
Symptoms may be delayed. 
 
 
Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved, and take precautions to 
protect themselves. 
 
 
 
Foam. Powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2). 
Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire. 
 
Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may explode when exposed to heat or flame. 
During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed. 
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with 
face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA. 
Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Containers should be cooled with 
water to prevent vapor pressure build up. For massive fire in cargo area, use unmanned hose 
holder or monitor nozzles, if possible. If not, withdraw and let fire burn out. 
Use standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials. Move 
containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. In the event of fire and/or explosion do not 
breathe fumes. 
Extremely flammable aerosol. 
 
6. Accidental release measures 
Personal  precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency  procedures 
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Wear 
appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Avoid breathing gas. Do not touch 
damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing. Ventilate 
closed spaces before entering them. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages 
cannot be contained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.

Precautions for safe handling 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conditions for safe storage, 
including any incompatibilities 
Refer to attached safety data sheets and/or instructions for use. Stop leak if you can do so without 
risk. Move the cylinder to a safe and open area if the leak is irreparable. Isolate area until gas has 
dispersed. Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). 
Keep combustibles (wood, paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. Prevent entry into 
waterways, sewer, basements or confined areas. Cover with plastic sheet to prevent spreading. 
Absorb in vermiculite, dry sand or earth and place into containers. Following product recovery, 
flush area with water. 
 
Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly to 
remove residual contamination. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS. 
Avoid release to the environment. Inform appropriate managerial or supervisory personnel of all 
environmental releases. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid discharge into 
drains, water courses or onto the ground. 
 
 
 
Pressurized container:  Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Do not use if spray button is missing 
or defective. Do not spray on a naked flame or any other incandescent material. Do not smoke 
while using or until sprayed surface is thoroughly dry. Do not cut, weld, solder, drill, grind, or 
expose containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. All equipment used when 
handling the product must be grounded. Do not re-use empty containers. Avoid breathing gas. 
Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Wear appropriate 
personal protective equipment. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Avoid release to the 
environment. Observe good industrial hygiene practices. 
Level 3 Aerosol. 
 
Store locked up. Pressurized container. Protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures 
exceeding 50°C/122 °F. Do not puncture, incinerate or crush. Do not handle or store near an open 
flame, heat or other sources of ignition. This material can accumulate static charge which may 
cause spark and become an ignition source. Store away from incompatible materials (see Section 
10 of the SDS).

Appropriate engineering 
controls 
Good general ventilation (typically 10 air changes per hour) should be used. Ventilation rates 
should be matched to conditions. If applicable, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, 
or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below recommended exposure limits. If 
exposure limits have not been established, maintain airborne levels to an acceptable level. Eye 
wash facilities and emergency shower must be available when handling this product. 
Individual protection measures,  such as personal protective equipment 
Eye/face protection
