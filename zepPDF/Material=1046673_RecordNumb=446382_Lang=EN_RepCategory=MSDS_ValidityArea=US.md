The glove material has to be impermeable and resistant to the product/ the substance/ the preparation.
Due to missing tests no recommendation to the glove material can be given for the product/ the preparation/
the chemical mixture.
Select glove material based on penetration times, rates of diffusion and degradation.
· Material of gloves
The selection of the suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality
and varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. As the product is a preparation of several substances, the
resistance of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the
application.
· Penetration time of glove material
The exact break-through time has to be determined and observed by the manufacturer of the protective
gloves.
· Eye protection: Tightly sealed goggles
