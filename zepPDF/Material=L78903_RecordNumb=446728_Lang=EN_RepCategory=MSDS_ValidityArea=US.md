SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
In the case of accident or if you feel unwell, seek medical 
advice immediately (show the label where possible). 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
In case of contact, immediately flush skin with soap and plenty 
of water. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Flush eyes with water at least 15 minutes. Get medical 
attention if eye irritation develops or persists. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If swallowed, DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do 
so by medical personnel. 
If swallowed, call a poison control centre or doctor 
immediately. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
May cause an allergic skin reaction. 
Causes serious eye irritation. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.

emergency procedures 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up
