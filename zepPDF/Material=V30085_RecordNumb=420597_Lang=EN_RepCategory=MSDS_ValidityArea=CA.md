minutes. 
If on skin, rinse well with water. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness.

Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain.

contact time). 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Harmful if swallowed. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.

carbon dioxide. 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses.
