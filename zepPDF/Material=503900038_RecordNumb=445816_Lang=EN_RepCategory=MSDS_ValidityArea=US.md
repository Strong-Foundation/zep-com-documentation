5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES 
 Flash point: 136℃ (276.8°F) (Cleveland Open Cup) 
 
 Suitable extinguishing media： 
  ・Fogged reinforced liquid, foam, powder or carbon dioxide is effective. 
  ・Use the powder and carbon dioxide for an initial fire. 
  ・It is effective to intercept air by using the fire foam for a large-scale fire. 
 
 Unsuitable extinguishing media： 
  ・Pouring water might expand a fire and be dangerous. 
  ・Do not use water to extinguish fire.

 Specific extinction method： 
  ・Do from the windward as much as possible when you work extinguishing fire. 
  ・Prohibit the entries other than parties concerned around the fire occurrence place. 
  ・Cut the combustion source to the place where the fire started. 
  ・Water the equipment of surroundings etc. and cool. 
 
 Protection of the person who extinguishes fire： 
  ・Battle the fires from windward side, and wear the protective equipment. 
  ・Wear the respiratory protective device because there is a possibility that a poisonous gas  
(carbon monoxide etc.) is generated by combustion or the high temperature. 
 
 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 (1) Promptly remove fire source and combustible articles from the surrounding area of leakage. 
 (2) Prepare proper fire extinguisher in preparation for the occurrence of fire. 
 (3) In case where the leakage amount is small: 
Absorb the solution with saw dust, soil and sand, waste cloth, paper, etc, and collect it to an  
empty container. After that, flush the surrounding area of leakage with adequate amount of 
water. Do not drain the cleaning water onto the ground or into drainage way. 
 (4) In case where the leakage amount is large: 
Prevent the outflow by sandbag, etc, and collect the solution by ladle into an empty container.  
Wear protective gloves, protective respirator and protective apron during the collection activity. 
 (5) When the leakage occurred inside the room, adequately ventilate by opening doors and windows. 
 (6) Pay attention so that the solution may not be discharged to the river of general drainage way. 
 (7) The wastes must be disposed of in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. 
 (8) Collect the solution using tools made of plastic so as to avoid the generation of spark. 
 
 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Precaution for handling

   solution adheres on the cloth. 
 
Precaution for storage 
(1) Tightly plug the container and sore it at well ventilated, cool and dark place avoiding the direct  
   sun beam and high temperature. 
 (2) Avoid the place where there is fire source, spark or substances of high temperature at the 
surrounding area. 
 (3) Keep this solution away from strong oxidizing agent, strong base and strong acid. 
 (4) Do not store this solution at the same place as the hazardous substance of different class. 
 
 
8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
Equipment measures : 
・When a mist and steam are generated, sealing up of the outbreak source or the setting of the  
local exhaust is desirable. 
・Establish the equipment for the eye washing and the body washing near the handling place.
