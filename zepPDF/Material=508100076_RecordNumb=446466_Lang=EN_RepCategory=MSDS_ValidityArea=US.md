4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Inhalation  
Symptoms & Effects: Irritation of the nose and airways, central nervous system depression, nausea, dizziness, 
drowsiness, weakness, fatigue, headache, lack of coordination, coma 
Measures:  Immediately remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing.  If 
breathing has stopped, begin artificial respiration.  If breathing is difficult, administer oxygen.  Seek immediate 
medical attention. 
 
Skin Contact  
Symptoms & Effects: Skin irritation, redness, burning, drying, cracking of the skin, dermatitis 
Measures:  Immediately wash skin with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  Remove contaminated 
clothing and shoes while washing.  Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.  If skin irritation persists, seek 
medical attention. 
 
Eye Contact  
Symptoms & Effects: Eye irritation, stinging, tearing, redness, swelling of the eyes 
Measures:  Immediately rinse eyes with water for at least 15 minutes.  Remove contact lenses after the initial 
few minutes and if easy to do so and resume rinsing.  Rinse beneath eyelids by holding eyelids apart with clean 
fingers while rinsing.  If eye irritation persists, seek medical attention. 
 
Ingestion  
Symptoms & Effects: Stomach or intestinal irritation, nausea, irritation of the throat, central nervous system 
depression, dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, fatigue, and headache.  Swallowing large amounts may cause for 
material to enter the lungs during swallowing or vomiting, leading to lung inflammation and other lung 
damages.

Measures:  Seek immediate medical attention.  Do NOT induce vomiting as this material is an aspiration 
hazard.  If the victim is drowsy or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth.  If victim is conscious, give at 
least 3-4 glasses of water.  Place individual on their left side and place their head down.  Do not leave victim 
unattended. 
 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable Extinguishing Media:  Carbon dioxide, Dry chemical, Foam, Water spray 
 
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media:  Water jet/stream (See precautions) 
 
Hazardous Combustion Products: Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide, Carbon dioxide  
 
Protective Equipment for Fire-Fighters:  Wear full firefighting turn-out gear (full Bunker gear), and 
respiratory protection (SCBA).   
 
Precautions for Fire-Fighters: Highly flammable liquid.  Vapors are heavier than air and may travel along 
the ground to some distance source of ignition and cause a flashback fire danger.  Direct water stream or water 
jets may create an additional fire hazard.  If a leak or spill has not ignited, use water spray to disperse the 
vapors and to protect personnel attempting to stop a leak.  Prevent runoff from fire control or dilution from 
entering streams, sewers, or drinking water supply.  Full-face, self-contained breathing apparatus should be 
worn at all times.  Use water spray to cool fire exposed surfaces and to protect personnel. 
 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Protective Equipment: Recommended to wear chemical splash goggles & resistant gloves and discard of 
gloves that show tears, pinholes, or signs of wear.  Wear proper garments to prevent skin exposure, such as 
long-sleeves and pants. 
 
Personal Precautions:  Persons not wearing proper PPE should be excluded from the area of contamination 
until clean-up has been completed.  Ensure adequate ventilation.  Eliminate all ignition sources and pay 
attention to the spreading of gases, especially at ground level. 
 
Environmental Precautions:  Do not allow discharge into drains, surface waters, or sanitary sewer system.  
Prevent spreading over a wide area by constructing a dike or using oil barriers.  Local authorities should be 
advised if significant spillages cannot be contained or if material discharges into drains or ground water. 
 
Methods & Materials for Clean-Up:  Immediately evacuate the spilled area and provide maximum 
ventilation.  Only personnel equipped with proper eye, and skin protection should be permitted in the area.  
Eliminate all ignition sources from the area.  All equipment used when handling the product must be grounded.  
Use clean, non-sparking tools to collect absorbed material.  Construct a dike to contain spill.  Contain spilled 
material with inert, non-combustible absorbent materials such as sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, or 
vermiculite.  After all visible traces have been removed, thoroughly wet vacuum the area.  Do not allow spilled

according to proper federal, state, and local regulations.  Notify the proper response units and agencies for any 
uncontained releases or spills. 
 
 
7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling: Containers of this material may be hazardous when emptied.  Since emptied containers still contain 
product residues (vapor, liquid, or solid), all hazard precautions given in this SDS must be observed.  Prevent 
exposure to ignition sources.  Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. – No smoking.  
Ground/bond container and receiving equipment.  Use explosion-proof electrical, ventilating, lighting, and 
other equipment.  Use only non-sparking tools.  Take precautionary measures against static discharge.  Do not 
cut, drill, grind, weld or perform similar operations on or near containers. 
 
Avoid breathing vapors or mists of this product.  Use product with adequate ventilation.  Avoid eye and skin 
contact with this material. Skin and eye PPE should be worn at all times when handling this product.  When 
adequate ventilation is not provided, respiratory PPE should also be used.  Hands and other exposed areas 
should be washed thoroughly with soap and water after contact, especially before eating and/or smoking.  Do 
not eat, drink or smoke when using this product.  
 
Storage: Store in a cool, dry, ventilated area, away from heat and ignition sources as well as from 
incompatible materials (see below).  Keep container tightly closed and store locked up.  Keep away from food, 
drink, and animal foodstuffs.

showers are proximal to the work location.  It is ultimately the responsibility of the employer to follow 
regulatory guidelines established by local authorities. 
 
Protective and Hygiene measures:  Do not inhale vapors.  Wash hands before breaks and immediately after 
handling product.  When using, do not eat, drink, or smoke.  In case of clothes contamination, remove and 
wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
 
Eye Protection: Recommended to wear tight fitting, chemical splash goggles when there is potential for the 
exposure of the eyes to the liquid, vapor or mist.  Have a suitable eye wash station or bottle nearby in case of 
splashing into the eyes. 
 
Hand Protection: Recommended to wear suitable resistant gloves and discard of gloves that show tears, 
pinholes, or signs of wear.  Suitable gloves will be based on product use and the period of use. 
 
Skin Protection: Recommended to wear long-sleeved clothing, pants and proper foot covering in order to 
prevent direct skin contact with the product.  If skin irritation develops, contact your facility health and safety 
professional or your local safety equipment supplier to determine the proper personal protective equipment for 
your use.   
 
Respiratory Protection: A NIOSH-approved air-purifying respirator with an appropriate cartridge and/or 
filter may be appropriate under certain circumstances where airborne concentrations are expected to exceed 
exposure limits (if applicable) or if overexposure has otherwise been determined.  Protection provided by air-
purifying respirators is limited.  Use a positive pressure, air-supplied respirator if there is any potential for 
uncontrolled release, exposure levels are not known or any other circumstances where an air-purifying 
respirator may not provide adequate protection.
