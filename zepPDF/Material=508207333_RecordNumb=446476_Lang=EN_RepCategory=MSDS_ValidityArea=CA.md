National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.

protection(s) are recommended:
Safety Glasses with side shields
Indirect Vented Goggles
Skin/hand protection
Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the 
results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the 
substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. 
Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective 
clothing.  Note: Nitrile gloves may be worn over polymer laminate gloves to improve dexterity.
Gloves made from the following material(s) are recommended: Polymer laminate
If this product is used in a manner that presents a higher potential for exposure (eg. spraying, high splash potential etc.), then 
use of protective coveralls may be necessary.  Select and use body protection to prevent contact based on the results of an 
exposure assessment.  The following protective clothing material(s) are recommended: Apron - polymer laminate
Respiratory protection
An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part 
of a full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following 
respirator type(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:
Half facepiece or full facepiece air-purifying respirator suitable for organic vapors and particulates

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.
