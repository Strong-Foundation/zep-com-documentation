If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal. 
Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use.

Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Always replace cap after use. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
No smoking. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards.
