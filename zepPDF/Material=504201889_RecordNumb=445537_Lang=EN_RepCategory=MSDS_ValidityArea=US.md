For Overdose Exposure By :
Swallowing
:
If swallowed, do not induce vomiting. CALL PHYSICIAN OR POISON
CONTROL CENTER IMMEDIATELY.
Skin Contact
:
Remove contaminated clothing and wash contaminated skin with large amounts
of water. If irritation persists, contact physician.
Eye Contact
:
Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes. CALL PHYSICIAN OR POISON
CONTROL CENTER IMMEDIATELY.
In case of fire: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers. Exercise caution when 
fighting any chemical fire. Prevent fire-fighting water from entering environment.
Dispose of contents/container in accordance with local/regional/national/international 
regulations.

Inhalation
:
Remove patient from contaminated area. If breathing has stopped, give artificial
respiration, then oxygen if needed. CALL PHYSICIAN OR POISON CONTROL
CENTER IMMEDIATELY.
4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
The most important known symptoms and effects are described in the labelling (see section 2.2) and/or in section 11.
Inhalation
:
Extremely high levels cause stupor, headache, nausea, dizziness and 
unconsciousness. 
Ingestion
:
Poisonous if swallowed. Can affect the optic nerve resulting in blindness. Can cause
mental sluggishness, nausea and vomiting leading to severe illness, possibly death (in
humans). 
Acute oral LC50's = 4,700 mg/kg (rats)   (Methyl Alcohol)
Eye Contact
:
May cause eye injury which may persist for several days. Liquid and vapor in high 
concentrations causes irritation, tearing and burning sensation.
Skin contact
Essentially non-irritating. Repeated or prolonged contact causes drying, brittleness,
cracking and irritation. 
Dermal LC50's = 20,000 mg/kg (rats)   (Methyl Alcohol)
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
SECTION 5 : FIREFIGHTING MEASURES
5.1 Extinguishing media
Suitable 
extinguishing 
media
:
Unsuitable 
extinguishing 
media
:
Treat symptomatically. The severity of outcome following methanol ingestion may be more related to the time between 
ingestion and treatment, rather than the amount ingested. Therefore, there is a need for rapid treatment of any ingestion 
exposure. Antidote is fomepizole which enhances elimination of metabolic formic acid. This must be administered by a 
physician only. For specialist advice physicians should contact the Poison Control Centre.
Synthetic Fire  fighting foam AR-FFF(3% solution). Dry powder. Carbon dioxide. Water 
spray. Sand.
Do not use a heavy water stream. Water may be effective for cooling, diluting, or dispersing 
product, but may not be effective for extinguishing a fire because it will not cool the product 
below its flash point. If water is used for cooling, the solution will spread if not contained. 
Mixtures of the product and water at concentrations greater than 20% product are still 
considered flammable.

6.4 Reference to other sections
For disposal see section 13.
Highly flammable liquid and vapor. Can accumulate in confined spaces, resulting in a toxicity 
and flammability hazard. Incomplete combustion releases dangerous carbon monoxide, carbon 
dioxide and other toxic gases. Under fire conditions closed containers may rupture or explode. 
Flame may be invisible during the day. The use of infrared and or heat detection devices is 
recommended.
May form flammable/explosive vapor-air mixture.
Stable normal conditions.
Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers. Exercise caution when fighting any 
chemical fire. Prevent fire-fighting water from entering environment.
Fire fighters should wear complete protective clothing including self-contained breathing 
apparatus.
Remove ignition sources. Use special care to avoid static electric charges. No naked lights. No 
smoking.
Prevent entry to sewers and public waters. Notify authorities if liquid enters sewers or public waters. Methanol’s main 
physical behavior if spilled to water is described as “dissolves/evaporates” in the European Behavior Classification 
system for chemicals (reported in IMO (2011)). GESAMP hazard profile: methanol does not bioaccumulate and is 
readily biodegradeable in the aquatic environment (IMO2011).
Soak up with inert absorbent material and dispose of as hazardous waste. Keep in suitable, closed containers for 
disposal.

Handle in the presence of adequate ventilation. Engineering controls should be used 
whenever feasible to maintain concentrations below acceptable exposure criteria, 
including enclosures and local exhaust ventilation.
Where exposure is likely to exceed acceptable criteria and engineering controls are 
not feasible, use NIOSH/MSHA approved respiratory protection equipment. 
Respirators should be selected based on the form and concentration of contaminants 
in air and in accordance with OSHA (29 CFR 1910.134)
Wear gloves and protective clothing which are impervious to the product for the 
duration of exposure if there is potential for skin contact.
