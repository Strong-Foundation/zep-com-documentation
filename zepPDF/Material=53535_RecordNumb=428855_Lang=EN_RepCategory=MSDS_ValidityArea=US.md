SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Symptoms of poisoning may appear several hours later. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off with soap and water. 
Take off contaminated clothing and shoes immediately. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Get medical attention if irritation develops and persists. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: If in eyes, rinse with water for 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Symptoms may differ depending on organs and systems 
affected.  These effects generally are reflected in reduced 
function or change, which may include cramping, swelling, 
respiratory issues, and general pain. 
Aspiration may cause pulmonary oedema and pneumonitis. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
May be fatal if swallowed and enters airways. 
Causes skin irritation. 
Causes serious eye irritation. 
Causes damage to organs. 
May cause drowsiness or dizziness. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards.

SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Alcohol-resistant foam 
Dry chemical 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media
