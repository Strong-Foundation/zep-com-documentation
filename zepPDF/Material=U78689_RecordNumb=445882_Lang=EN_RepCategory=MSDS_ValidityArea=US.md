4. FIRST-AID MEASURES 
First Aid Measures  
 
General 
Advice  
Provide this SDS to medical personnel for treatment.  
Eye Contact  
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for 15 minutes. Get medical attention, if irritation persists 
Skin Contact  
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Skin will turn white on contact. Immediately flush skin with plenty of 
water for at least 15 minutes. Get medical attention. Wash clothing before reuse. Thoroughly clean shoes before 
reuse. 
Inhalation  
Remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Get immediate 
medical attention. If unconscious, place in recovery position and get medical attention immediately. Maintain an 
open airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt, or waistband. 
Ingestion  
Give victim a glass of water. Get immediate medical attention. Do not induce vomiting unless instructed to do so by 
poison center or physician. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.  
Most important symptoms and effects  
Symptoms  
EYES: Adverse symptoms may include pain or irritation, watering, and redness. Can cause serious eye damage. 
SKIN: Adverse symptoms may include irritation and redness. 
INGESTION: Adverse symptoms may include nausea and vomiting. 
INHALATION: Adverse symptoms may include respiratory tract irritation and coughing.  
Notes to 
Physician  
Treat symptomatically.  
5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES 
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media       
Not determined. 
Specific Hazards Arising from the 
Chemical  
Product is not combustible or an explosive 
Protective equipment and 
precautions for firefighters  
 
Promptly remove all persons from the vicinity of the incident if there is a fire. Move containers 
from fire area if this can be done without risk. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers 
cool. In the event of a fire, wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self-contained 
breathing apparatus with full face piece operated in the pressure demand or other positive 
pressure mode. Increases the flammability of combustible, organic and readily oxidizable 
materials.  
Fire Explosion 
Heating may cause an explosion.

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures  
 
Personal 
Precautions  
Wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection. 
 
Environmental 
Precautions  
 
Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with waterways, drains and sewers. Inform the relevant 
authorities if the product has caused environmental pollution (sewers or waterways). 
GENERAL PROCEDURES: Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains, and 
sewers. Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental pollution (sewers, waterways, soil, 
or air). Water polluting material. May be harmful to the environment if released in large quantities. 
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up  
 
Methods for 
Containment  
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so.  
Methods for 
Clean-Up  
SMALL SPILL: Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Dilute with water and mop if water-soluble. 
Alternately, or if water-soluble, absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste disposal 
container. Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor. 
LARGE SPILL: Dike area to contain spill. Wash the spill site with water. See section 13, Disposal Considerations, for 
additional information. 
 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Precautions for safe handling  
 
Advice on Safe 
Handling  
Use only in a well ventilated area. 
Do not get in eyes. Do not swallow. Avoid breathing vapor. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Wash 
thoroughly after handling. Keep container closed. Use with adequate ventilation. See section 8, Exposure Controls and 
Personal Protection. 
Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities  
 
Storage 
Conditions  
Store in accordance with local regulations. Store in a segregated and approved area in original container protected 
from sunlight in a dry, cool and well-ventilated and approved area away from incompatible materials. Keep container 
closed to prevent drying out. Move container away from oxidizing materials. Use appropriate containment to avoid 
environmental contamination. 
STORAGE TEMPERATURE: Store away from heat sources and direct sunlight. Ideal storage temperature is 60-68F.  
Incompatible 
Materials  
Heavy metal ions, excessive alkalis, and combustible materials.
