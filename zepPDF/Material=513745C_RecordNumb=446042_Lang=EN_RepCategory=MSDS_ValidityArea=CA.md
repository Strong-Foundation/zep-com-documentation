Protection of first-aiders
: No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training.  If it is
suspected that fumes are still present, the rescuer should wear an appropriate mask or
self-contained breathing apparatus.  It may be dangerous to the person providing aid to
give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  Wash contaminated clothing thoroughly with water
before removing it, or wear gloves.
Use an extinguishing agent suitable for the surrounding fire.
Fire-fighting measures
Extinguishing media
Promptly isolate the scene by removing all persons from the vicinity of the incident if

Special protective
equipment for fire-fighters
Fire-fighters should wear appropriate protective equipment and self-contained breathing
apparatus (SCBA) with a full face-piece operated in positive pressure mode.
:
:
Spilled material is slippery. No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without
suitable training.  Evacuate surrounding areas.  Keep unnecessary and unprotected
personnel from entering.  Do not touch or walk through spilled material.  Do not breathe
dust.  Provide adequate ventilation.  Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is
inadequate.  Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (see section 8).
Environmental precautions
Accidental release measures
: Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains
and sewers.  Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental
pollution (sewers, waterways, soil or air).

Methods for cleaning up
Move containers from spill area.  Vacuum or sweep up material and place in a
designated, labeled waste container.  Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal
contractor.
:
Spill or leak
Store in accordance with local regulations.  Store in original container protected from
direct sunlight in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area, away from incompatible materials
and food and drink.  Keep container tightly closed and sealed until ready for use.
Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to
prevent leakage.  Do not store in unlabeled containers.  Use appropriate containment to
avoid environmental contamination.
Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (see section 8).  Eating, drinking and
smoking should be prohibited in areas where this material is handled, stored and
processed.  Workers should wash hands and face before eating, drinking and smoking.
Do not get in eyes or on skin or clothing.  Do not breathe dust.  Do not ingest.  Use only
with adequate ventilation.  Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is inadequate.
Keep in the original container or an approved alternative made from a compatible
material, kept tightly closed when not in use.  Empty containers retain product residue
and can be hazardous.  Do not reuse container.

Engineering measures
: Use only with adequate ventilation.  If user operations generate dust, fumes, gas, vapor
or mist, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls
to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any recommended or statutory
limits.
Hygiene measures
: Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before
eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.  Appropriate
techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.  Wash
contaminated clothing before reusing.  Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers
are close to the workstation location.
Recommended monitoring
procedures
: If this product contains ingredients with exposure limits, personal, workplace atmosphere
or biological monitoring may be required to determine the effectiveness of the ventilation
or other control measures and/or the necessity to use respiratory protective equipment.

Use a properly fitted, air-purifying or air-fed respirator complying with an approved
standard if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary.  Respirator selection must be
based on known or anticipated exposure levels, the hazards of the product and the safe
working limits of the selected respirator.
Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk
assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists or
dusts.  If operating conditions cause high dust concentrations to be produced, use dust
goggles.  Recommended: splash goggles
Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being
performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling
this product.
Recommended: chemical-resistant protective suit

Environmental exposure
controls
: Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure they
comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation.  In some cases,
fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will be
necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.
