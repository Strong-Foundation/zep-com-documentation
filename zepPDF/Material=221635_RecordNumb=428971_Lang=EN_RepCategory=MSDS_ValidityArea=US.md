SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, 
for at least 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do NOT induce vomiting. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms

and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
observed during an exposure. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Acute specific target organ toxicity effects will differ depending 
on mode of exposure (oral, dermal, and inhalation), the 
organs and systems affected, and any preexisting medical 
conditions.   Symptoms may include respiratory difficulty, 
abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, vomiting, 
central nervous system depression, blurred vision, seizures, 
and unconsciousness - potentially life threatening. 
Symptoms may include shortness of breath, dry cough, and 
irritation of the nose, eyes, lips, mouth, and throat. 
Harmful if swallowed. 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
May cause cancer. 
Harmful if inhaled. 
May cause respiratory irritation. 
May cause drowsiness or dizziness. 
Suspected of causing genetic defects. 
May cause damage to organs. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
Contact a poison treatment specialist immediately if large 
quantities have been ingested or inhaled, or contact with large 
portions of the body have occurred.

: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to 
local / national regulations (see section 13). 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: No smoking. 
Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated 
place. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Oxidizing agents 
Keep away from metals. 
Store and keep away from bases and alkalies.
