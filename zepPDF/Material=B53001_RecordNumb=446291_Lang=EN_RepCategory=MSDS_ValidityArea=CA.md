In case of eczema or other skin disorders: Seek medical attention and take along these
instructions.
Skin contact
Rinse with water. Get medical attention if irritation develops and persists.
Eye contact
Not likely, due to the form of the product.
Ingestion
May cause an allergic skin reaction. Dermatitis. Rash.

Symptoms may be delayed.
Indication of immediate
medical attention and special
treatment needed
IF exposed or concerned: Get medical advice/attention. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice
(show the label where possible). Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s)
involved, and take precautions to protect themselves. Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in
attendance. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.
General information
5. Fire-fighting measures
Water spray. Water fog. Foam. Dry chemical powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2).
Suitable extinguishing media
None known.
Unsuitable extinguishing
media
Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may explode when exposed to heat or flame.
During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed.
Specific hazards arising from
the chemical
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with
face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA.
Special protective equipment
and precautions for firefighters
In case of fire: Stop leak if safe to do so. Do not move cargo or vehicle if cargo has been exposed
to heat. Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Containers should be cooled
with water to prevent vapor pressure build up. For massive fire in cargo area, use unmanned hose
holder or monitor nozzles, if possible. If not, withdraw and let fire burn out.
Fire fighting
equipment/instructions
Use standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials. Move
containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Cool containers exposed to flames with
water until well after the fire is out. In the event of fire and/or explosion do not breathe fumes.
Specific methods
Extremely flammable aerosol. Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may explode when
exposed to heat or flame.
General fire hazards
6. Accidental release measures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Keep out of
low areas. Many gases are heavier than air and will spread along ground and collect in low or
confined areas (sewers, basements, tanks). Wear appropriate protective equipment and clothing
during clean-up. Avoid breathing gas. Emergency personnel need self-contained breathing
equipment. Do not touch damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate
protective clothing. Ventilate closed spaces before entering them. Local authorities should be
advised if significant spillages cannot be contained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the
SDS.

SDS US
Refer to attached safety data sheets and/or instructions for use. Stop leak if you can do so without
risk. Move the cylinder to a safe and open area if the leak is irreparable. Use water spray to reduce
vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. Eliminate all ignition
sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Keep combustibles (wood,
paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. Prevent entry into waterways, sewer, basements or
confined areas. Following product recovery, flush area with water. For waste disposal, see section
13 of the SDS.
Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up
Avoid release to the environment. Inform appropriate managerial or supervisory personnel of all
environmental releases. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid discharge into
drains, water courses or onto the ground.
Environmental precautions
7. Handling and storage
Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read
and understood. Pressurized container:  Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Do not use if spray
button is missing or defective. Do not spray on a naked flame or any other incandescent material.
Do not smoke while using or until sprayed surface is thoroughly dry. Do not cut, weld, solder, drill,
grind, or expose containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. All equipment used
when handling the product must be grounded. Close valve after each use and when empty. Protect
cylinders from physical damage; do not drag, roll, slide, or drop. When moving cylinders, even for
short distances, use a cart (trolley, hand truck, etc.) designed to transport cylinders. Suck back of
water into the container must be prevented. Do not allow backfeed into the container. Purge air
from system before introducing gas. Use only properly specified equipment which is suitable for
this product, its supply pressure and temperature.  Contact your gas supplier if in doubt. Do not
re-use empty containers. Avoid breathing gas. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women must not handle this product. Should be handled in closed
systems, if possible. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Wear appropriate personal protective
equipment. Avoid release to the environment. Observe good industrial hygiene practices.
Precautions for safe handling
Level 2 Aerosol.
Store locked up. Pressurized container. Protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures
exceeding 50°C/122 °F. Do not puncture, incinerate or crush. Do not handle or store near an open
flame, heat or other sources of ignition. This material can accumulate static charge which may
cause spark and become an ignition source. Store in a well-ventilated place. Cylinders should be
stored upright, with valve protection cap in place, and firmly secured to prevent falling or being
knocked over. Stored containers should be periodically checked for general condition and leakage.
Store away from incompatible materials (see Section 10 of the SDS).
