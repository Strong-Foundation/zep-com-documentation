SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1 Precautions and safe handling
- Do not expose children and pets to this material.
- After handling product, wash thoroughly with soap and water before drinking, eating, or smoking.
- Keep away from open flames.
7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
7.3 Specific end use(s)
The identified uses for this product are detailed in section 1.2.
No recommendation given, but first aid may still be required in case of accidental exposure, inhalation or ingestion of this 
chemical. If in doubt, GET MEDICAL ATTENTION PROMPTLY!
Individuals should perform only those firefighting procedures for which they have been trained. Use water spray, dry chemical, 
alcohol foam or carbon dioxide. Use water to keep fire-exposed containers cool. If a spill or leak has not ignited, use water spray 
to disperse the vapors. Water spray may be used to flush spills away from fire and diluted spills to noncombustible 
proportions(see warning on water spray on hot liquid below.)
- Do not store at temperatures above 104°F; Normal room temperature is satisfactory. Incompatible with strong acids, bases and 
oxidizers, chromium trioxide, potassium permanganate, and sodium peroxide.
Fire fighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus in the positive pressure mode with a full face piece when, there is a 
possibility of exposure to smoke, fumes or hazardous decomposition products. Water spray may cause foaming of hot glycol so 
indirect application of water spray or use of other extinguishing media should be used on hot liquid.
Soak up with inert absorbent material and dispose in accordance with local/resional/national/international regulations. Keep in 
suitable, closed containers for disposal.
For personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures, see section 8. In case of spills, beware of slippery 
floors and surfaces.

Handle in the presence of adequate ventilation. Engineering controls should be used whenever feasible to 
maintain concentrations below acceptable exposure criteria, including enclosures and local exhaust 
ventilation.
Where exposure is likely to exceed acceptable criteria and engineering controls are not feasible, use 
NIOSH/MSHA approved respiratory protection equipment. Respirators should be selected based on the 
form and concentration of contaminants in air and in accordance with OSHA (29 CFR 1910.134)
Wear gloves and protective clothing which are impervious to the product for the duration of exposure if 
there is potential for skin contact.
Item
Value/Range
Wear safety glasses meeting the specifications of ANSI Standard Z87.1 where no contact with the eye is
