Description of First Aid Measures 
General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where 
possible). 
 
Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Remove to fresh air and keep at rest in a position 
comfortable for breathing. Immediately call a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician. 
 
Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. Immediately call a POISON 
CENTER or doctor/physician. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
 
Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. 
Immediately call a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician. 
 
Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Immediately call a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician. 
 
Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed 
General: Causes serious eye damage. Corrosive. Causes burns. Contact may cause immediate severe irritation progressing quickly to
