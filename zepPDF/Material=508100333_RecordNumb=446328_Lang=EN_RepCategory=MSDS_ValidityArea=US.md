4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
Description of first aid measures 
General advice:  
First Aid responders should pay attention to self-protection and use the recommended protective 
clothing (chemical resistant gloves, splash protection).  If potential for exposure exists refer to Section 
8 for specific personal protective equipment.   
 
Inhalation: Move person to fresh air.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration; if by mouth to mouth 
use rescuer protection (pocket mask, etc).  If breathing is difficult, oxygen should be administered by 
qualified personnel.  Call a physician or transport to a medical facility.   
 
Skin contact: Remove material from skin immediately by washing with soap and plenty of water.  
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes while washing.  Seek medical attention if irritation persists. 
Wash clothing before reuse.  An MDI skin decontamination study demonstrated that cleaning very 
soon after exposure is important, and that a polyglycol-based skin cleanser or corn oil may be more 
effective than soap and water.  Discard items which cannot be decontaminated, including leather 
articles such as shoes, belts and watchbands.  Suitable emergency safety shower facility should be 
available in work area.   
 
Eye contact: Flush eyes thoroughly with water for several minutes.  Remove contact lenses after the 
initial 1-2 minutes and continue flushing for several additional minutes.  If effects occur, consult a 
physician, preferably an ophthalmologist.  Suitable emergency eye wash facility should be available in 
work area.   
 
Ingestion: If swallowed, seek medical attention.  Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by 
medical personnel.   
 
Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed:  
Aside from the information found under Description of first aid measures (above) and Indication of 
immediate medical attention and special treatment needed (below), any additional important 
symptoms and effects are described in Section 11: Toxicology Information. 
 
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed 
Notes to physician: May cause respiratory sensitization or asthma-like symptoms.  Bronchodilators, 
expectorants and antitussives may be of help.  Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and 
oral or parenteral corticosteroids.  Respiratory symptoms, including pulmonary edema, may be 
delayed. Persons receiving significant exposure should be observed 24-48 hours for signs of 
respiratory distress.  Maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation of the patient.  If you are 
sensitized to diisocyanates, consult your physician regarding working with other respiratory irritants or 
sensitizers.  Treatment of exposure should be directed at the control of symptoms and the clinical 
condition of the patient.  Excessive exposure may aggravate preexisting asthma and other respiratory 
disorders (e.g. emphysema, bronchitis, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome).   
 
5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
Extinguishing media 
 
Suitable extinguishing media: Water fog or fine spray..  Dry chemical fire extinguishers..  
Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers..  Foam..  Alcohol resistant foams (ATC type) are preferred. 
General purpose synthetic foams (including AFFF) or protein foams may function, but will be 
less effective..  Water fog, applied gently may be used as a blanket for fire extinguishment..   
Product name: BETASEAL™ Express+ Urethane Adhesive

Unsuitable extinguishing media: Do not use direct water stream..  May spread fire..   
 
Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture 
 
Hazardous combustion products: During a fire, smoke may contain the original material in 
addition to combustion products of varying composition which may be toxic and/or irritating..  
Combustion products may include and are not limited to:.  Nitrogen oxides..  Carbon 
monoxide..  Carbon dioxide..  Combustion products may include trace amounts of:.  Hydrogen 
cyanide..   
 
Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards: Product reacts with water.  Reaction may produce 
heat and/or gases..  Any closed container may rupture when exposed to extreme heat in a fire 
situation..  Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water 
stream to hot liquids..  Dense smoke is produced when product burns..   
 
Advice for firefighters 
 
Fire Fighting Procedures: Keep people away.  Isolate fire and deny unnecessary entry..  
Use water spray to cool fire exposed containers and fire affected zone until fire is out and 
danger of reignition has passed..  Fight fire from protected location or safe distance. Consider 
the use of unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles..  Immediately withdraw all personnel 
from the area in case of rising sound from venting safety device or discoloration of the 
container..  Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire..  Move container from fire area if 
this is possible without hazard..  Burning liquids may be moved by flushing with water to 
protect personnel and minimize property damage..  Water fog, applied gently may be used as 
a blanket for fire extinguishment..  Contain fire water run-off if possible. Fire water run-off, if 
not contained, may cause environmental damage..  Review the "Accidental Release 
Measures" and the "Ecological Information" sections of this (M)SDS..   
 
Special protective equipment for firefighters: Wear positive-pressure self-contained 
breathing apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, 
coat, trousers, boots, and gloves)..  Avoid contact with this material during fire fighting 
operations. If contact is likely, change to full chemical resistant fire fighting clothing with self-
contained breathing apparatus.  If this is not available, wear full chemical resistant clothing 
with self-contained breathing apparatus and fight fire from a remote location..  For protective 
equipment in post-fire or non-fire clean-up situations, refer to the relevant sections..   
 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: Isolate area.  Keep 
unnecessary and unprotected personnel from entering the area.  Keep upwind of spill.  Ventilate area 
of leak or spill.  Refer to section 7, Handling, for additional precautionary measures.  See Section 10 
for more specific information.  Use appropriate safety equipment. For additional information, refer to

Although some of the components of this product may have exposure guidelines, no exposure would 
be expected under normal handling conditions due to the physical state of the material.   
 
 
Exposure controls 
Engineering controls: Use only with adequate ventilation.  Local exhaust ventilation may be 
necessary for some operations.  Provide general and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne 
levels below the exposure guidelines.  Exhaust systems should be designed to move the air away 
from the source of vapor/aerosol generation and people working at this point.  The odor and irritancy 
of this material are inadequate to warn of excessive exposure.   
 
Individual protection measures 
Eye/face protection: Use safety glasses (with side shields).   
Skin protection 
Hand protection: Use gloves chemically resistant to this material.  Examples of preferred glove 
barrier materials include:  Butyl rubber.  Chlorinated polyethylene.  Polyethylene.  Ethyl vinyl alcohol 
laminate ("EVAL").  Examples of acceptable glove barrier materials include:  Neoprene.  
Nitrile/butadiene rubber ("nitrile" or "NBR").  Polyvinyl chloride ("PVC" or "vinyl").  Viton.  NOTICE: The

selection of a specific glove for a particular application and duration of use in a workplace should also 
take into account all relevant workplace factors such as, but not limited to: Other chemicals which may 
be handled, physical requirements (cut/puncture protection, dexterity, thermal protection), potential 
body reactions to glove materials, as well as the instructions/specifications provided by the glove 
supplier.   
Other protection: Use protective clothing chemically resistant to this material.  Selection of specific 
items such as face shield, boots, apron, or full body suit will depend on the task.   
Respiratory protection: Atmospheric levels should be maintained below the exposure guideline. 
When atmospheric levels may exceed the exposure guideline, use an approved air-purifying respirator 
equipped with an organic vapor sorbent and a particle filter.  For situations where the atmospheric 
levels may exceed the level for which an air-purifying respirator is effective, use a positive-pressure 
air-supplying respirator (air line or self-contained breathing apparatus).  For emergency response or 
for situations where the atmospheric level is unknown, use an approved positive-pressure self-
contained breathing apparatus or positive-pressure air line with auxiliary self-contained air supply.   
The following should be effective types of air-purifying respirators:  Organic vapor cartridge with a 
particulate pre-filter.

11. TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION 
 
Toxicological information appears in this section when such data is available. 
 
Acute toxicity 
Acute oral toxicity 
Low toxicity if swallowed.  Small amounts swallowed incidentally as a result of normal 
handling operations are not likely to cause injury; however, swallowing larger amounts may 
cause injury.  May cause abdominal discomfort or diarrhea.  May cause nausea and vomiting.   
Single dose oral LD50 has not been determined.   
 
Acute dermal toxicity 
Prolonged skin contact is unlikely to result in absorption of harmful amounts.   
The dermal LD50 has not been determined.   
 
Acute inhalation toxicity 
At room temperature, exposure to vapor is minimal due to low volatility. Vapor from heated 
material may cause respiratory irritation and other effects.  The data presented are for the 
following material:  Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI).  Decreased lung function has 
been associated with overexposure to isocyanates.  Excessive exposure may cause irritation 
to upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) and lungs.  May cause pulmonary edema (fluid in 
the lungs.)  Effects may be delayed.  This material contains mineral and/or inorganic fillers. 
There is essentially no potential for inhalation exposure to these fillers incidental to industrial 
handling due to the physical state.   
The LC50 has not been determined.

Skin corrosion/irritation 
Prolonged contact may cause moderate skin irritation with local redness. 
Material may stick to skin causing irritation upon removal. 
 
Serious eye damage/eye irritation 
May cause eye irritation. 
 
Sensitization 
For skin sensitization: 
A component in this mixture has been shown to be a skin sensitizer. 
Animal studies have shown that skin contact with isocyanates may play a role in respiratory 
sensitization. 
 
For respiratory sensitization: 
A component in this mixture may cause an allergic respiratory response. 
MDI concentrations below the exposure guidelines may cause allergic respiratory reactions in 
individuals already sensitized. 
Asthma-like symptoms may include coughing, difficult breathing and a feeling of tightness in the chest. 
Occasionally, breathing difficulties may be life threatening. 
 
Specific Target Organ Systemic Toxicity (Single Exposure) 
Evaluation of available data suggests that this material is not an STOT-SE toxicant. 
 
Specific Target Organ Systemic Toxicity (Repeated Exposure) 
Contains component(s) which have been reported to cause effects on the following organs in animals: 
Kidney. 
Liver. 
Tissue injury in the upper respiratory tract and lungs has been observed in laboratory animals after 
repeated excessive exposures to MDI/polymeric MDI aerosols. 
 
Carcinogenicity 
Lung tumors have been observed in laboratory animals exposed to respirable aerosol droplets of 
MDI/Polymeric MDI (6 mg/m3) for their lifetime.  Tumors occurred concurrently with respiratory 
irritation and lung injury.  Current exposure guidelines are expected to protect against these effects 
reported for MDI.  For the phthalate ester(s):  Kidney effects and/or tumors have been observed in 
male rats. These effects are believed to be species specific and unlikely to occur in humans.  Liver 
effects and/or tumors have been observed in rats. These effects are believed to be species specific 
and unlikely to occur in humans.   
 
Teratogenicity 
Contains component(s) which did not cause birth defects in animals; other fetal effects occurred only 
at doses toxic to the mother.   
 
Reproductive toxicity 
For the phthalate ester(s):  In laboratory animals, excessive doses toxic to the parent animals caused 
decreased weight and survival of offspring.  There were no effects on fertility at any dose.   
 
Mutagenicity 
Contains a component(s) which were negative in in vitro genetic toxicity studies.  Genetic toxicity data 
on MDI are inconclusive. MDI was weakly positive in some in vitro studies; other in vitro studies were 
negative.  Animal mutagenicity studies were predominantly negative.
