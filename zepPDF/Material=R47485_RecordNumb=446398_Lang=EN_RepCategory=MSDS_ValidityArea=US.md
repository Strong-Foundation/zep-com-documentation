4.  FIRST AID MEASURES  
Inhalation:  In case of inhalation, take the injured into the fresh air. If dizziness persists or symptoms of 
respiratory tract occur, immediately call 911. 
Skin Contact:  In case of skin contact, rinse with water. 
Eye Contact: Immediately flush with water. If irritation persists, contact doctor. 
Ingestion:  Rinse mouth with water, drink water. 
Measures that can be taken only by doctor:  Effect can be considered as slight intoxication with 
chlorine. In case of suspicions of intoxication with this material, contact immediately the nearest first aid, 
poison control center or local Emergency room.   
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES  
Flammability of the Product:  Non-Flammable 
Suitable fire extinguishing measures:  N/A. 
Hazardous Thermal Decomposition Products:  Trace amounts of chlorine gas may be present if 
product is exposed to extreme heat.   
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES  
Measures of collective protection and personal protection: 
When washing or rinsing spilled 
product, it is recommended to ventilate the room, wear waterproof gloves.  Take appropriate measures to 
avoid inhaling vapours.   
Environment pollution preventive measures:  N/A 
Gathering and neutralization measures: Clean and gather the spilled preparation with any 
absorbing material.  Additional decontamination ways are not necessary as Anolite decomposes within 
hours, returning to its initial state - water and salt. Do not use the gathered preparation for its purpose, it 
is can be emptied into sanitary sewer.   
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE  
Requirements and recommendations for handling:  Handle in accordance with the requirements 
of handling instructions found on the product label.

Storage temperature should not be less than 5oC. 
Requirements to packing of chemical material, preparation: 
Tightly closed plastic bottles, 
reservoirs or containers, meant for storing Anolite by the user.  Packaging must always be market with an 
approved label.  
8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
Avoid direct contact with eyes, mucous membranes or direct inhalation of product. With continuous direct 
skin contact, recommend wearing protective latex or similar gloves. Product can bleach clothing if direct 
contact occurs.

11.  TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION  
Acute toxicity on animals:  
Indigestion, LD50 :  Tests with rats have established that even concentrated, 0.05 % Anolite 
solutions do not cause death. 
Inhalation, LC50:  Not established. 
Through skin, LD50 :  Not established. 
Irritation:  Tests with rats guinea-pigs have established that long-term skin contact of 
concentrated, 0.05% Anolite solutions can cause dermatitis.  
Other effects on animals: 
Tests have established that lethal to animals can be only 
concentrated 0.05 % Anolite solution injections, however lethal effects could not be achieved 
even after prolonged use of such concentration solutions.  
Effects on human: 
Inhalation:  In case of correct use of Anolite, real danger does not exist. However when mixing 
concentrated solutions with acids or acidic preparations bigger quantity of chlorine can be 
emitted. Chlorine vapour has a pickling effect. Burning sense can occur, difficult and more rapid 
breathing, headache, dizziness, soar can tingle. After some time symptoms similar to asthma can 
occur. Long-term effect causes lung oedema.  
Eye contact:  Possible tingle, eye redness. 
Skin contact:  0.05% Anolite can cause skin irritation, redness if skin is sensitive. Tests with 
animals have established that long –term repeated effect can cause dermatitis.  
Ingestion:  Test data does not exist. 
Sensitization:  Tests with guinea-pigs have established that even long-term contact does not 
cause allergy. 
Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, toxicity to reproduction:  During tests with animals these 
effects have not been established. It is not harmful, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic to warm-blooded 
organisms and animals.   
12.  ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION  
Chemical material, preparation properties with possible effect for environment:  Hazardous 
for pathogenic organisms, viruses, and mildew fungi as a disinfectant. 
Ecotoxicity (toxicity for water, soil organisms, other animals and plants):  Lethal 
concentrations: 
Fish:  Not established 
Daphnias:  Tests have established that concentrated Anolite solutions attenuated in ratio 1:500 
are not hazardous for daphnias 
Mobility:  Rapidly dissolves and resolves in water, dissipates. 
Dissipation and decay (biodegradation) in environment:  When getting into environment 
concentration of active chlorine decreases depending on water pH, microbiological, organic 
contamination, materials dissolved in it. The higher environment contamination, the quicker Anolite 
decays and neutralises. 
Bioaccumulation:  N/A 
Data on other effects:  N/A   
13.  CHEMICAL MATERIAL, PREPARATION WASTE HANDLING  
Chemical material, preparation waste, contaminated packaging disposal ways: Remainders 
can be emptied to sewage. It neutralizes itself resolving into water and sodium chloride.   
14.  CHEMICAL MATERIAL, PREPARATION TRANSPORTATION  
Preparation in tightly closed packages can be transported by any transport.
