SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
4.1 Description of First Aid Measures 
 
Inhalation: Not a likely route of exposure. Remove to fresh air if irritation occurs. If symptoms develop, obtain medical attention. 
 
Skin Contact: Exposure to skin normally does not cause irritation or redness. No toxicity associated with the product being absorbed through skin. 
Wash exposed areas with water. In the unlikely event of irritation, seek medical advice. 
 
Eye Contact: This product may cause irritation to the eyes after direct contact with concentrate. Rinse with water for several minutes. Remove 
contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. 
 
Ingestion: No toxicity associated with ingestion. Ingesting large volumes may cause minor gastrointestinal distress due to separation of grease and 
oil in the digestive tract. Drink water to assist in digestion if swallowed. 
 
4.2 Most Important Symptoms and Effects, Both Acute and Delayed  
 
Acute: Ingestion will cause minor distress to the gastrointestinal tract. May cause chemical and mechanical eye irritation with direct contact. 
 
Delayed and Chronic Effects: Expected to be similar to acute exposures. 
 
4.3 Indication of the Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed: Treat symptomatically. 
 
SECTION 5: FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Not flammable or combustible by OSHA/WHMIS criteria. Not sensitive to mechanical impact and static discharge.
