4. First-aid Measures
FIRST AID - EYE CONTACT: Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes holding eyelids open.  Get medical 
attention.  Do NOT allow rubbing of eyes or keeping eyes closed.
FIRST AID - SKIN CONTACT: Wash skin with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing. Get medical attention if irritation 
develops or persists.
FIRST AID - INHALATION: Remove to fresh air.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration.  If breathing is difficult, give oxygen.  Get 
immediate medical attention.  Do NOT use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  If you experience difficulty in breathing, leave the area to 
obtain fresh air.  If continued difficulty is experienced, get medical assistance immediately.
FIRST AID - INGESTION: Aspiration hazard:  Do not induce vomiting or give anything by mouth because this material can enter the 
lungs and cause severe lung damage.  Get immediate medical attention.  If swallowed, get medical attention.
5. Fire-fighting Measures
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA:
Alcohol Film Forming Foam, Carbon Dioxide, Dry Chemical, Water Fog
UNUSUAL FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS: FLASH POINT IS LESS THAN 20°F. EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE LIQUID AND 
VAPOR!Water spray may be ineffective.  Closed containers may explode when exposed to extreme heat due to buildup of steam.  
Closed containers may explode when exposed to extreme heat.  Vapors may form explosive mixtures with air.  Vapors can travel to a 
source of ignition and flash back.  Keep containers tightly closed.  Isolate from heat, electrical equipment, sparks and open flame.  
Perforation of the pressurized container may cause bursting of the can.  No unusual fire or explosion hazards noted.
Page 2 / 6
Date Printed:  10/19/2015
SPECIAL FIREFIGHTING PROCEDURES: Water may be used to cool closed containers to prevent pressure buildup and possible 
autoignition or explosion.  Full protective equipment including self-contained breathing apparatus should be used.  Evacuate area and 
fight fire from a safe distance.  Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool. Containers may explode when heated.
6. Accidental Release Measures
STEPS TO BE TAKEN IF MATERIAL IS RELEASED OR SPILLED: Contain spilled liquid with sand or earth.  DO NOT use 
combustible materials such as sawdust.  Isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected personnel.  Remove 
all sources of ignition, ventilate area and remove with inert absorbent and non-sparking tools.  Dispose of according to local, state 
(provincial) and federal regulations.  Do not incinerate closed containers.  Ventilate area, isolate spilled material, and remove with 
inert absorbent.  Dispose of contaminated absorbent, container, and unused contents in accordance with local, state, and federal 
regulations.
7. Handling and Storage
HANDLING: Wash thoroughly after handling.  Wash hands before eating.  Remove contaminated clothing and launder before reuse.  
Use only in a well-ventilated area.  Use only with adequate ventilation.  Follow all MSDS/label precautions even after container is 
emptied because it may retain product residues.  Avoid breathing fumes, vapors, or mist.  Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing.
STORAGE: Store in a dry, well ventilated place. Keep container tightly closed when not in use.  Keep containers tightly closed.  
Isolate from heat, electrical equipment, sparks and open flame.  Contents under pressure. Do not store above 120 ° F.  Store large 
quantities in buildings designed and protected for storage of NFPA Class I flammable liquids.  Keep away from heat, sparks, flame 
and sources of ignition.  Contents under pressure.  Do not expose to heat or store above 120 ° F.  Avoid excess heat.  Product should 
be stored in tightly sealed containers and protected from heat, moisture, and foreign materials.

PERSONAL PROTECTION
ENGINEERING CONTROLS: Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to control airborne 
levels below recommended exposure limits.  Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment.  Provide general dilution of local exhaust 
ventilation in volume and pattern to keep TLV of hazardous ingredients below acceptable limits.  Prevent build-up of vapors by 
opening all doors and windows to achieve cross-ventilation.
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: A respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 1910.134 and ANSI Z88.2 requirements must be 
followed whenever workplace conditions warrant a respirator's use.  A NIOSH/MSHA approved air purifying respirator with organic 
vapor cartridge or canister may be permissible under certain circumstances where airborne concentrations are expected to exceed 
exposure limits.
SKIN PROTECTION: Use gloves to prevent prolonged skin contact.  Use impervious gloves to prevent skin contact and absorption of 
this material through the skin.  Nitrile or Neoprene gloves may afford adequate skin protection.
EYE PROTECTION: Use safety eyewear designed to protect against splash of liquids.
OTHER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT: Refer to safety supervisor or industrial hygienist for further guidance regarding types of 
personal protective equipment and their applications.  Refer to safety supervisor or industrial hygienist for further information 
regarding personal protective equipment and its application.
HYGIENIC PRACTICES: Wash thoroughly with soap and water before eating, drinking or smoking.  Remove contaminated clothing 
immediately and launder before reuse.

11. Toxicological information
EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE - EYE CONTACT: Causes Serious Eye Irritation
EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE - SKIN CONTACT: Substance may cause slight skin irritation.  May be absorbed through the skin 
in harmful amounts.  May cause skin irritation.  Allergic reactions are possible.  Prolonged or repeated contact may cause skin 
irritation.
EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE - INHALATION: Harmful if inhaled.  High gas, vapor, mist or dust concentrations may be harmful if 
inhaled.  Avoid breathing fumes, spray, vapors, or mist.  High vapor concentrations are irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  
Prolonged or excessive inhalation may cause respiratory tract irritation.
EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE - INGESTION: Harmful if swallowed.  Aspiration hazard if swallowed; can enter lungs and cause 
damage.
EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE - CHRONIC HAZARDS: May cause central nervous system disorder (e.g., narcosis involving a 
loss of coordination, weakness, fatigue, mental confusion, and blurred vision) and/or damage.  High concentrations may lead to 
central nervous system effects (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, headaches, paralysis, and blurred vision) and/or damage.  Reports 
have associated repeated and prolonged occupational overexposure to solvents with permanent brain and nervous system damage.  
Overexposure to xylene in laboratory animals has been associated with liver abnormalities, kidney, lung, spleen, eye and blood 
damage as well as reproductive disorders.  Effects in humans, due to chronic overexposure, have included liver, cardiac 
abnormalities and nervous system damage.  IARC lists Ethylbenzene as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B).  Contains Titanium 
Dioxide. Titanium Dioxide is listed as a Group 2B-"Possibly carcinogenic to humans" by IARC. No significant exposure to Titanium 
Dioxide is thought to occur during the use of products in which Titanium Dioxide is bound to other materials, such as in paints during 
brush application or drying. Risk of overexposure depends on duration and level of exposure to dust from repeated sanding of 
surfaces or spray mist and the actual concentration of Titanium Dioxide in the formula. (Ref: IARC Monograph, Vol. 93, 2010)
