SECTION 4: FIRST-AID MEASURES
4.1
Description of necessary measures:
Request medical assistance immediately, showing the SDS of this product.
By inhalation:
This product does not contain substances classified as hazardous for inhalation, however, in case of symptoms of intoxication
remove the person affected from the exposure area and provide with fresh air. Seek medical attention if the symptoms get worse
or persist.
By skin contact:
Remove contaminated clothing and footwear, rinse skin or shower the person affected if appropriate with plenty of cold water and
neutral soap. In serious cases see a doctor. If the product causes burns or freezing, clothing should not be removed as this could
worsen the injury caused if it is stuck to the skin. If blisters form on the skin, these should never be burst as this will increase the
risk of infection.
By eye contact:
Rinse eyes thoroughly with lukewarm water for at least 15 minutes. Do not allow the person affected to rub or close their eyes. If
the injured person uses contact lenses, these should be removed unless they are stuck to the eyes, as this could cause further
damage. In all cases, after cleaning, a doctor should be consulted as quickly as possible with the SDS of the product.
By ingestion/aspiration:
Request immediate medical assistance, showing the SDS of this product. Do not induce vomiting, because its expulsion from the
stomach can be hazardous to the mucus of the main digestive tract, and its inhalation, to the respiratory system. Rinse out the
mouth and throat, as they may have been affected during ingestion. In the case of loss of consciousness do not administrate
anything orally unless supervised by a doctor. Keep the person affected at rest.
4.2
Most important symptoms/effects, acute and delayed:
Acute and delayed effects are indicated in sections 2 and 11.

according to 29 CFR 1910.1200
SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES (continued)
Product is non-flammable under normal conditions of storage, manipulation and use. In the case of inflammation as a result of
improper manipulation, storage or use preferably use polyvalent powder extinguishers (ABC powder), in accordance with the
Regulation on fire protection systems. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED to use tap water as an extinguishing agent.
5.2
Specific hazards arising from the chemical:
As a result of combustion or thermal decomposition reactive sub-products are created that can become highly toxic and,
consequently, can present a serious health risk.
5.3
Special protective equipment and precautions for fire-fighters:
Depending on the magnitude of the fire it may be necessary to use full protective clothing and individual respiratory equipment.
Minimum emergency facilities and equipment should be available (fire blankets, portable first aid kit,...)
Additional provisions:
As in any fire, prevent human exposure to fire, smoke, fumes or products of combustion. Only properly trained personnel should
be involved in firefighting. Evacuate nonessential personnel from the fire area. Destroy any source of ignition. In case of fire,
refrigerate the storage containers and tanks for products susceptible to inflammation. Avoid spillage of the products used to
extinguish the fire into an aqueous medium.
SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
6.1
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures:
Isolate leaks provided that there is no additional risk for the people performing this task. Personal protection equipment must be
used against potential contact with the spilt product (See section 8). Evacuate the area and keep out those who do not have
protection.
6.2
Environmental precautions:
The characteristic of corrosivity per RCRA could apply to the unused product if it becomes a waste material. The EPA hazardous
waste number D002 could apply. It is the responsibility of the waste generator to evaluate whether his wastes are hazardous by
characteristics or listing.
6.3
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up:
It is recommended:
Absorb the spillage using sand or inert absorbent and move it to a safe place. Do not absorb in sawdust or other combustible
absorbents. For any concern related to disposal consult section 13.
6.4
Reference to other sections:
See sections 8 and 13.
SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1
Precautions for safe handling:

Comply with the current standards 29 CFR 1910 Occupational Safety and Health Standards. Keep containers hermetically
sealed. Control spills and residues, destroying them with safe methods (section 6). Avoid leakages from the container.
Maintain order and cleanliness where dangerous products are used.
B.- Technical recommendations for the prevention of fires and explosions
Product is non-flammable under normal conditions of storage, manipulation and use. It is recommended to transfer at slow
speeds to avoid the generation of electrostatic charges that can affect flammable products. Consult section 10 for information
on conditions and materials that should be avoided.
C.- Technical recommendations to prevent ergonomic and toxicological risks
PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO THIS PRODUCT. Transfer in fixed places that comply with the
necessary security conditions (emergency showers and eyewash stations in close proximity), using personal protection
equipment, especially on the hands and face (See section 8). Limit manual transfers to containers of small amounts. Do not
eat or drink during the process, washing hands afterwards with suitable cleaning products.
D.- Technical recommendations to prevent environmental risks
It is recommended to have absorbent material available at close proximity to the product (See subsection 6.3)
