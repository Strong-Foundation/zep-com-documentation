SECTION 4: First aid measures 
 
Eye Contact:  For direct contact, remove contact lenses if present and easy to do. Immediately hold eyelids apart and flush the 
affected eye(s) with clean water for at least 20 minutes. Seek immediate medical attention.  
Skin Contact:  Remove contaminated shoes and clothing, and flush affected area(s) with large amounts of water. If skin surface is 
damaged, apply a clean dressing and seek medical attention. If skin surface is not damaged, cleanse affected area(s) thoroughly 
by washing with mild soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner. If irritation or redness develops, seek medical attention. Wash 
contaminated clothing before reuse.  
Inhalation:  If respiratory symptoms develop, move victim away from source of exposure and into fresh air in a position 
comfortable for breathing. If breathing is difficult, oxygen or artificial respiration should be administered by qualified personnel. If 
symptoms persist, seek medical attention.  
Ingestion:  Aspiration hazard: Do not induce vomiting or give anything by mouth because this material can enter the lungs and 
cause severe lung damage. If victim is drowsy or unconscious and vomiting, place on the left side with the head down. If possible, 
do not leave victim unattended and observe closely for adequacy of breathing. Seek medical attention.  
Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed:  While significant vapor concentrations are not likely, high 
concentrations can cause minor respiratory irritation, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, loss of coordination, disorientation and 
fatigue.  Ingestion can cause irritation of the digestive tract, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Light hydrocarbon gases are simple 
asphyxiants and can cause anesthetic effects at high concentrations.  Symptoms of overexposure, which are reversible if exposure 
is stopped, can include shortness of breath, drowsiness, headaches, confusion, decreased coordination, visual disturbances and 
vomiting.  Continued exposure can lead to hypoxia (inadequate oxygen), rapid breathing, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the 
skin), numbness of the extremities, unconsciousness and death. Prolonged or repeated contact may dry skin and cause irritation.  
SECTION 5: Firefighting measures 
 
NFPA 704: National Fire Protection Association  
 
Extinguishing Media:  Dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or foam is recommended.  Water spray is recommended to cool or protect 
exposed materials or structures.  Carbon dioxide can displace oxygen.  Use caution when applying carbon dioxide in confined 
spaces. Simultaneous use of foam and water on the same surface is to be avoided as water destroys the foam. Water may be 
ineffective for extinguishment, unless used under favorable conditions by experienced fire fighters.

devices such as cell phones, computers, calculators, and pagers which have not been certified as intrinsically safe). Vapors 
may travel considerable distances to a source of ignition where they can ignite, flash back, or explode. May create vapor/air 
explosion hazard indoors, in confined spaces, outdoors, or in sewers. This product will float and can be reignited on surface 
water. Vapors are heavier than air and can accumulate in low areas. If container is not properly cooled, it can rupture in the 
heat of a fire.  
Hazardous Combustion Products:  Combustion may yield smoke, carbon monoxide, and other products of incomplete 
combustion.  Oxides of nitrogen and sulfur may also be formed.  
Special protective actions for fire-fighters:  For fires beyond the initial stage, emergency responders in the immediate hazard 
area should wear protective clothing.  When the potential chemical hazard is unknown, in enclosed or confined spaces, a self 
contained breathing apparatus should be worn.  In addition, wear other appropriate protective equipment as conditions warrant 
(see Section 8). Isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected personnel. Stop spill/release if it can be 
done safely. Move undamaged containers from immediate hazard area if it can be done safely. Water spray may be useful in 
minimizing or dispersing vapors and to protect personnel. Avoid spreading burning liquid with water used for cooling purposes. 
Cool equipment exposed to fire with water, if it can be done safely.  
See Section 9 for Flammable Properties including Flash Point and Flammable (Explosive) Limits  
SECTION 6: Accidental release measures 
 
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures:  Extremely flammable. Spillages of liquid product 
will create a fire hazard and may form an explosive atmosphere. Keep all sources of ignition and hot metal surfaces away from 
spill/release if safe to do so. The use of explosion-proof electrical equipment is recommended. Stay upwind and away from 
spill/release. Avoid direct contact with material. For large spillages, notify persons down wind of the spill/release, isolate immediate 
hazard area and keep unauthorized personnel out. Wear appropriate protective equipment, including respiratory protection, as 
conditions warrant (see Section 8). See Sections 2 and 7 for additional information on hazards and precautionary measures.  
Environmental Precautions:  Stop and contain spill/release if it can be done safely. Prevent spilled material from entering 
sewers, storm drains, other unauthorized drainage systems, and natural waterways. Use foam on spills to minimize vapors Use 
water sparingly to minimize environmental contamination and reduce disposal requirements. If spill occurs on water notify 
appropriate authorities and advise shipping of any hazard.  
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up:  Notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable 
regulations. 
Recommended measures are based on the most likely spillage scenarios for this material; however local conditions and 
regulations may influence or limit the choice of appropriate actions to be taken.  
SECTION 7: Handling and storage 
 
Precautions for safe handling:  Keep away from heat, hot surfaces, sparks, open flames and other ignition sources. No smoking. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharge. Use non-sparking tools. Do not puncture or incinerate cans. Do not stick pin 
or any other sharp object into opening on top of can. Avoid contact with eyes. Avoid contact with skin. Do not breathe vapor or mist. 
Use only with adequate ventilation. Wash thoroughly after handling. Wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face 
protection. Use good personal hygiene practices and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (see section 8).  Extremely 
Flammable. Contents under pressure. Open container slowly to relieve any pressure. May vaporize easily at ambient temperatures.  
The vapor is heavier than air and may create an explosive mixture of vapor and air.  Beware of accumulation in confined spaces 
and low lying areas. Electrostatic charge may accumulate and create a hazardous condition when handling or processing this 
material.  To avoid fire or explosion, dissipate static electricity during transfer by grounding and bonding containers and equipment 
before transferring material. The use of explosion-proof electrical equipment is recommended and may be required (see 
appropriate fire codes).  Refer to NFPA-70 and/or API RP 2003 for specific bonding/grounding requirements. Do not enter confined 
spaces such as tanks or pits without following proper entry procedures such as ASTM D-4276 and 29CFR 1910.146. Do not wear 
contaminated clothing or shoes. Keep contaminated clothing away from sources of ignition such as sparks or open flames.

Engineering controls:  If current ventilation practices are not adequate to maintain airborne concentrations below the established 
exposure limits, additional engineering controls may be required.  
Eye/Face Protection:  The use of eye protection (such as splash goggles) that meets or exceeds ANSI Z.87.1 is recommended 
when there is potential liquid contact to the eye.  Depending on conditions of use, a face shield may be necessary.  
Skin/Hand Protection:  The use of gloves impervious to the specific material handled is advised to prevent skin contact. Users 
should check with manufacturers to confirm the breakthrough performance of their products. Depending on exposure and use 
conditions, additional protection may be necessary to prevent skin contact including use of items such as chemical resistant boots, 
aprons, arm covers, hoods, coveralls, or encapsulated suits. Suggested protective materials: Butyl rubber  
Respiratory Protection:   Where there is potential for airborne exposure above the exposure limit a NIOSH certified air purifying 
respirator equipped with organic vapor cartridges/canisters with R or P95 filters may be used. 
A respiratory protection program that meets or is equivalent to OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 and ANSI Z88.2 should be followed 
whenever workplace conditions warrant a respirator's use. A NIOSH approved, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or 
equivalent operated in a pressure demand or other positive pressure mode should be used in situations of oxygen deficiency 
(oxygen content less than 19.5 percent), unknown exposure concentrations, or situations that are immediately dangerous to life or 
health (IDLH).  
Other Protective Equipment:   Eye wash and quick-drench shower facilities should be available in the work area.  Thoroughly 
clean shoes and wash contaminated clothing before reuse.  
Suggestions provided in this section for exposure control and specific types of protective equipment are based on readily 
available information.  Users should consult with the specific manufacturer to confirm the performance of their protective 
equipment.  Specific situations may require consultation with industrial hygiene, safety, or engineering professionals.

Information on Toxicological Effects of Components  
Petroleum distillates, hydrotreated light 
Reproductive Toxicity:  Hydrodesulfurized kerosene applied to the skin of female rats at 494, 330, or 165 mg/kg daily for 7 
consecutive weeks (premating, mating, and gestation), or for 8 consecutive weeks in males did not result in systemic, 
reproductive, or developmental toxicity. 
Petroleum gases, liquefied, sweetened 
Reproductive Toxicity:  No adverse developmental effects were observed in rats exposed to concentrations of isobutane as 
high as 9000 ppm. Fertility and mating indices may have been affected at 9000 ppm but no effects were observed at 3000 ppm 
(NOAEL). 
Target Organ(s):  No systemic or neurotoxic effects were noted in rats exposed to concentrations of isobutane as high as 
9,000 ppm for 28 days. 
Solvent naphtha, petroleum, light aliphatic 
Carcinogenicity:  Two year inhalation studies of vaporized unleaded gasoline produced an increased incidence of kidney 
tumors in male rats and liver tumors in female mice.  Repeated skin application of various petroleum naphthas in mice for two 
years resulted in an increased incidence of skin tumors but only in the presence of severe skin irritation. Follow-up mechanistic 
studies suggest that the occurrence of these tumors may be the consequence of promotional processes and not relevant to 
human risk assessment.   Epidemiology data collected from a study of more than 18,000 petroleum marketing and distribution 
workers showed no increased risk of leukemia, multiple myeloma, or kidney cancer from gasoline exposure.  Unleaded 
gasoline has been identified as a possible carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. 
Reproductive Toxicity:  No evidence of developmental toxicity was found in pregnant laboratory animals (rats and mice) 
exposed to high vapor concentrations of unleaded gasoline and petroleum naphthas via inhalation.  A two-generation 
reproductive toxicity study of vapor recovery gasoline did not adversely affect reproductive function or offspring survival and 
development. 
Target Organ(s):  Two year inhalation studies of wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline, and 90 days studies of various 
petroleum naphthas, did not produce significant target organ toxicity in laboratory animals. Nephropathy in male rats, 
characterized by the accumulation of alpha-2-u- globulin in epithelial cells of the proximal tubules was observed, however 
follow-up studies suggest that these changes are unique to the male rat.

Reproductive Toxicity:  No evidence of developmental toxicity was found in pregnant laboratory animals (rats and mice) 
exposed to high vapor concentrations of unleaded gasoline and petroleum naphthas via inhalation.  A two-generation 
reproductive toxicity study of vapor recovery gasoline did not adversely affect reproductive function or offspring survival and 
development. 
Target Organ(s):  Two year inhalation studies of wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline, and 90 days studies of various 
petroleum naphthas, did not produce significant target organ toxicity in laboratory animals. Nephropathy in male rats, 
characterized by the accumulation of alpha-2-u- globulin in epithelial cells of the proximal tubules was observed, however 
follow-up studies suggest that these changes are unique to the male rat. 
SECTION 12: Ecological information 
 
Toxicity:  Toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment  
Persistence and Degradability:  The hydrocarbons in this material are not readily biodegradable but are regarded as inherently 
biodegradable since their hydrocarbon components can be degraded by microorganisms.  
Bioaccumulative Potential:  Hydrocarbon constituents of kerosine show measured or predicted Log Kow values ranging from 3 
to 6 and above and therefore would be regarded as having the potential to bioaccumulate. In practice, metabolic processes may 
reduce bioconcentration.  
Mobility in Soil:  On release to water, hydrocarbons will float on the surface and since they are sparingly soluble, the only 
significant loss is volatilization to air. It is possible that some of the higher molecular weight hydrocarbons will be adsorbed on 
sediment. Biodegradation in water is a minor loss process. In air, these hydrocarbons are photodegraded by reaction with hydroxyl 
radicals with half lives varying from 0.1 to 0.7 days.  
Other adverse effects:  None anticipated.  
SECTION 13: Disposal considerations  
 
The generator of a waste is always responsible for making proper hazardous waste determinations and needs to consider state 
and local requirements in addition to federal regulations.  This material, if discarded as produced, would be a federally regulated 
RCRA "listed" hazardous waste, and identified as the EPA hazardous waste number shown below.  See Sections 7 and 8 for 
information on handling, storage and personal protection and Section 9 for physical/chemical properties. It is possible that the 
material as produced contains constituents which are not required to be listed in the SDS but could affect the hazardous waste 
determination. Additionally, use which results in chemical or physical change of this material could subject it to regulation as a 
hazardous waste.Container contents should be completely used and containers should be emptied prior to discard. Container 
residues and rinseates could be considered to be hazardous wastes.
