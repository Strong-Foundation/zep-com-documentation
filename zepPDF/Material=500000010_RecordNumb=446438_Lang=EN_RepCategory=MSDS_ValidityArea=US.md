concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products

carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide 
formaldehyde-like 
Aldehydes 
nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
 
:  
 
 
 Product is compatible with standard fire-fighting agents. 
 
Further information 
: Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters

Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
Persons not wearing protective equipment should be excluded 
from area of spill until clean-up has been completed.

absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to 
local / national regulations (see section 13). 
 
Other information 
 
: Comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. 
Suppress (knock down) gases/vapours/mists with a water 
spray jet. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Do not smoke. 
Container hazardous when empty. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations.

circumstances where airborne concentrations are expected to 
exceed exposure limits (if applicable) or if overexposure has 
otherwise been determined.  Protection provided by air-
purifying respirators is limited.  Use a positive pressure, air-
supplied respirator if there is any potential for uncontrolled 
release, exposure levels are not known or any other 
circumstances where an air-purifying respirator may not 
provide adequate protection. 
 
Hand protection 
    Remarks 
:  The suitability for a specific workplace should be discussed 
with the producers of the protective gloves.  
 
Eye protection 
:  Wear chemical splash goggles and face shield when there is 
potential for exposure of the eyes or face to liquid, vapor or 
mist. 
Maintain eye wash station in immediate work area. 
 
Skin and body protection 
: 
Wear as appropriate: 
Impervious clothing 
Safety shoes 
Flame-resistant clothing 
Choose body protection according to the amount and 
concentration of the dangerous substance at the work place. 
Wear resistant gloves (consult your safety equipment 
supplier). 
 
Hygiene measures 
: 
Wash hands before breaks and at the end of workday. 
When using do not eat or drink. 
When using do not smoke.
