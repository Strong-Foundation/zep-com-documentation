SECTION 4: First-Aid Measures
 Eye contact
 Rinse immediately and thoroughly with water including under the eyelids for at least 15 minutes. 
 Get medical attention.
 Skin contact
 Rinse the contacted skin area thoroughly with plenty of water as soon as possible(if available with soap). 
 Remove contaminated clothing and footwear. Get medical attention. Wash clothing before reuse.
 Inhalation
 Expose to fresh air. If no breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. 
 Get medical attention.
 Ingestion
 Do not induce vomiting. Never give anything by mouth under the condition of unconsciousness. 
 Get medical attention.
 Symptoms
See Section 11.
SECTION 5: Fire-Fighting Measures
 Extinguishing media
Water spray, water fog, extinguishing foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.
 Specific firefighting procedures
Wear self-contained breathing gears and full protective clothing, such as turn-out gear. 
In case of fire, keep containers cool by spraying water.
 Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
 Closed containers may rupture due to build up internal pressure upon exposing to extreme heat.
 Hazardous combustion products
 Oxides of carbon. Oxides of Metals in Section 3. Toxic and irritating vapors.
SECTION 6: Accidental Release Measures
         Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected personnel.
 Environmental precautions
 Do not allow product to enter sewer or waterways.

 Clean-up methods
 Remove all sources of ignition. Ensure adequate ventilation. Perform in isolated area. 
 Keep unnecessary personnel away.
 Soak up with inert absorbent material(e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust).
 Store in a closed container until ready for disposal. 
Refer to Section 8 "Exposure Controls / Personal Protection" prior to clean up.
SECTION 7: Handling and Storage
 Handling
 Use only with adequate ventilation. Prevent contact with eyes, skin and clothing.
 Do not breathe vapor and mist. Wash thoroughly after handling. Refer to Section 8
 Storage
 Keep in a cool, well ventilated area away from heat, sparks and open flame.
Keep container tightly closed until ready for use
