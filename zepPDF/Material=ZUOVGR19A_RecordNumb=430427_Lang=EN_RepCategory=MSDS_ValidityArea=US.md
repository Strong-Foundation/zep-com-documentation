SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Get medical attention immediately. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty.

Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible

container for disposal. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Always replace cap after use. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
Observe label precautions. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Do not store near acids. 
Oxidizing agents
