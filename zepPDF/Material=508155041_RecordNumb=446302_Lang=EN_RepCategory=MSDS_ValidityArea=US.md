4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
Description of first aid measures 
Product name: BETAPRIME™ 5504G-SA 
Issue Date: 10/19/2021
 
 
 
Page 4 of 28 
 
General advice:  
First Aid responders should pay attention to self-protection and use the recommended protective 
clothing (chemical resistant gloves, splash protection).  If potential for exposure exists refer to Section 
8 for specific personal protective equipment.   
 
Inhalation: Move person to fresh air.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration; if by mouth to mouth 
use rescuer protection (pocket mask, etc).  If breathing is difficult, oxygen should be administered by 
qualified personnel.  Call a physician or transport to a medical facility.   
 
Skin contact: Remove material from skin immediately by washing with soap and plenty of water.  
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes while washing.  Seek medical attention if irritation persists. 
Wash clothing before reuse.  An MDI skin decontamination study demonstrated that cleaning very 
soon after exposure is important, and that a polyglycol-based skin cleanser or corn oil may be more 
effective than soap and water.  This may also apply to other isocyanates.  Discard items which cannot 
be decontaminated, including leather articles such as shoes, belts and watchbands.  Suitable 
emergency safety shower facility should be available in work area.   
 
Eye contact: Immediately flush eyes with water; remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 
minutes, then continue flushing eyes for at least 15 minutes. Obtain medical attention without delay, 
preferably from an ophthalmologist.  Suitable emergency eye wash facility should be immediately 
available.   
 
Ingestion: Do not induce vomiting. Call a physician and/or transport to emergency facility 
immediately.   
 
Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed:  
Aside from the information found under Description of first aid measures (above) and Indication of 
immediate medical attention and special treatment needed (below), any additional important 
symptoms and effects are described in Section 11: Toxicology Information. 
 
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed 
Notes to physician: Maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation of the patient.  May cause 
respiratory sensitization or asthma-like symptoms.  Bronchodilators, expectorants and antitussives 
may be of help.  Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids.  
Respiratory symptoms, including pulmonary edema, may be delayed. Persons receiving significant 
exposure should be observed 24-48 hours for signs of respiratory distress.  If you are sensitized to 
diisocyanates, consult your physician regarding working with other respiratory irritants or sensitizers.  
Treatment of exposure should be directed at the control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the 
patient.  Excessive exposure may aggravate preexisting asthma and other respiratory disorders (e.g. 
emphysema, bronchitis, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome).   
 
5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
Suitable extinguishing media: Water fog or fine spray.  Dry chemical fire extinguishers.  Carbon 
dioxide fire extinguishers.  Foam.  Alcohol resistant foams (ATC type) are preferred. General purpose 
synthetic foams (including AFFF) or protein foams may function, but will be less effective.   
 
Unsuitable extinguishing media: Do not use direct water stream.  Straight or direct water streams 
may not be effective to extinguish fire.   
 
Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture

Page 5 of 28 
 
Hazardous combustion products: During a fire, smoke may contain the original material in addition 
to combustion products of varying composition which may be toxic and/or irritating.  Combustion 
products may include and are not limited to:  Nitrogen oxides.  Carbon monoxide.  Carbon dioxide.   
 
Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards: Container may vent and/or rupture due to fire.  Electrically 
ground and bond all equipment.  Flammable mixtures of this product are readily ignited even by static 
discharge.  Vapors are heavier than air and may travel a long distance and accumulate in low lying 
areas. Ignition and/or flash back may occur.  Flammable mixtures may exist within the vapor space of 
containers at room temperature.  Flammable concentrations of vapor can accumulate at temperatures 
above flash point; see Section 9.     
 
Advice for firefighters 
Fire Fighting Procedures: Keep people away.  Isolate fire and deny unnecessary entry.  Stay 
upwind. Keep out of low areas where gases (fumes) can accumulate.  Water may not be effective in 
extinguishing fire.  Use water spray to cool fire exposed containers and fire affected zone until fire is 
out and danger of reignition has passed.  Burning liquids may be extinguished by dilution with water.  
Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire.  Eliminate ignition sources.  Move container from fire 
area if this is possible without hazard.  Burning liquids may be moved by flushing with water to protect 
personnel and minimize property damage.  Avoid accumulation of water. Product may be carried 
across water surface spreading fire or contacting an ignition source.  Contain fire water run-off if 
possible. Fire water run-off, if not contained, may cause environmental damage.  Review the 
"Accidental Release Measures" and the "Ecological Information" sections of this (M)SDS.   
 
Special protective equipment for firefighters: Wear positive-pressure self-contained breathing 
apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, coat, trousers, 
boots, and gloves).  Avoid contact with this material during fire fighting operations. If contact is likely, 
change to full chemical resistant fire fighting clothing with self-contained breathing apparatus.  If this is 
not available, wear full chemical resistant clothing with self-contained breathing apparatus and fight 
fire from a remote location.  For protective equipment in post-fire or non-fire clean-up situations, refer 
to the relevant sections.   
 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: Evacuate area.  Only 
trained and properly protected personnel must be involved in clean-up operations.  Keep personnel 
out of low areas.  Keep upwind of spill.  Ventilate area of leak or spill.  No smoking in area.  Eliminate 
all sources of ignition in vicinity of spill or released vapor to avoid fire or explosion.  Vapor explosion 
hazard. Keep out of sewers.  For large spills, warn public of downwind explosion hazard.  Check area 
with combustible gas detector before reentering area. Ground and bond all containers and handling 
equipment.  Refer to section 7, Handling, for additional precautionary measures.  Use appropriate 
safety equipment. For additional information, refer to Section 8, Exposure Controls and Personal 
Protection.   
 
Environmental precautions: Prevent from entering into soil, ditches, sewers, waterways and/or 
groundwater. See Section 12, Ecological Information.   
 
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up: Contain spilled material if possible.  
Absorb with materials such as:  Cat litter.  Sand.  Sawdust.  Ground and bond all containers and 
handling equipment.  Pump with explosion-proof equipment. If available, use foam to smother or 
suppress.  Collect in suitable and properly labeled containers.  See Section 13, Disposal 
Considerations, for additional information.

Exposure controls 
Engineering controls: Use only with adequate ventilation.  Local exhaust ventilation may be 
necessary for some operations.  Provide general and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne 
levels below the exposure guidelines.  Exhaust systems should be designed to move the air away 
from the source of vapor/aerosol generation and people working at this point.  The odor and irritancy 
of this material are inadequate to warn of excessive exposure.   
 
Individual protection measures 
Eye/face protection: Use chemical goggles.  If exposure causes eye discomfort, use a full-face 
respirator.   
Skin protection 
Hand protection: Use gloves chemically resistant to this material.  Examples of preferred glove 
barrier materials include:  Butyl rubber.  Polyethylene.  Ethyl vinyl alcohol laminate ("EVAL").  
Examples of acceptable glove barrier materials include:  Chlorinated polyethylene.  Neoprene.  
Nitrile/butadiene rubber ("nitrile" or "NBR").  Viton.  NOTICE: The selection of a specific glove for a 
particular application and duration of use in a workplace should also take into account all relevant 
workplace factors such as, but not limited to: Other chemicals which may be handled, physical 
requirements (cut/puncture protection, dexterity, thermal protection), potential body reactions to glove 
materials, as well as the instructions/specifications provided by the glove supplier.   
Other protection: Use protective clothing chemically resistant to this material.  Selection of specific 
items such as face shield, boots, apron, or full body suit will depend on the task.   
Respiratory protection: Atmospheric levels should be maintained below the exposure guideline. 
When atmospheric levels may exceed the exposure guideline, use an approved air-purifying respirator 
equipped with an organic vapor sorbent and a particle filter.  For situations where the atmospheric 
levels may exceed the level for which an air-purifying respirator is effective, use a positive-pressure 
air-supplying respirator (air line or self-contained breathing apparatus).  For emergency response or 
Product name: BETAPRIME™ 5504G-SA

Page 9 of 28 
 
for situations where the atmospheric level is unknown, use an approved positive-pressure self-
contained breathing apparatus or positive-pressure air line with auxiliary self-contained air supply.   
The following should be effective types of air-purifying respirators:  Organic vapor cartridge with a 
particulate pre-filter.

For respiratory sensitization: 
A component in this mixture may cause an allergic respiratory response. 
Reexposure to extremely low isocyanate concentrations may cause allergic respiratory reactions in 
individuals already sensitized. 
Asthma-like symptoms may include coughing, difficult breathing and a feeling of tightness in the chest. 
Occasionally, breathing difficulties may be life threatening. 
 
Specific Target Organ Systemic Toxicity (Single Exposure) 
Contains component(s) which are classified as specific target organ toxicant, single exposure, 
category  3. 
 
Specific Target Organ Systemic Toxicity (Repeated Exposure) 
Contains component(s) which have been reported to cause effects on the following organs in animals: 
Liver. 
Respiratory tract. 
Tissue injury in the upper respiratory tract and lungs has been observed in laboratory animals after 
repeated excessive exposures to MDI/polymeric MDI aerosols. 
Methyl ethyl ketone has caused liver effects in laboratory animals exposed by inhalation to high 
concentrations. 
Methyl ethyl ketone is probably not neurotoxic in itself but it potentiates the neurotoxicity of methyl-n-
butyl ketone and n-hexane. 
 
Carcinogenicity 
Lung tumors have been observed in laboratory animals exposed to respirable aerosol droplets of 
MDI/Polymeric MDI (6 mg/m3) for their lifetime.  Tumors occurred concurrently with respiratory 
irritation and lung injury.  Current exposure guidelines are expected to protect against these effects 
reported for MDI.  Contains component(s) which have caused cancer in some laboratory animals.   
 
Teratogenicity 
Contains component(s) which did not cause birth defects in animals; other fetal effects occurred only 
at doses toxic to the mother.  Contains component(s) which caused birth defects in laboratory animals 
only at doses toxic to the mother.   
 
Reproductive toxicity 
For the component(s) tested:  In animal studies, did not interfere with reproduction.   
 
Mutagenicity 
For the component(s) tested:  In vitro genetic toxicity studies were predominantly negative.  Animal 
genetic toxicity studies were negative.
