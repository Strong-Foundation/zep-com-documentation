5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
Suitable Extinguishing Media:  Use media that is appropriate for surrounding fire; unused 
product is not combustible. 
Specific Hazards Arising from the Chemical:  No specific hazards are known. 
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-fighters:  Firefighters should 
always wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing for fires involving 
chemicals or in confined spaces. 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment, and Emergency Procedures:  No special 
equipment is generally required for spill clean-up. For dusty conditions, an approved respirator 
may be needed. Refer to Section 8 for additional information. 
Environmental Hazards:  Report releases as required by local and federal regulations. 
Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up:  Sweep up and collect unused 
material for re-use or disposal.  For dusty conditions, an approved respirator may be needed. Refer 
to Section 8 for additional information. 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Precautions for Safe Handling:  Avoid breathing dust.  Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and 
clothing. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after use. If clothing becomes dusty, launder 
before re-use. Use only with adequate ventilation. Minimize the generation and accumulation of 
dust.  Follow good housekeeping practices to keep surfaces, including areas overhead such as 
piping, drop ceilings, ductwork, etc. free from settled dust.  Dry powders can build static electricity 
charges when subjected to friction of transfer and in mixing operations. 
Conditions for Safe Storage, including any Incompatibilities:  Store in a dry area. Keep 
away from turpentine, hydrofluoric acid, vegetable oil, and other unsaturated organic compounds 
(such as fish oil), as this may generate heat and/or fire.

Individual Protection Measures, such as Personal Protective Equipment:   
Eye Protection:  Safety goggles if needed to prevent eye contact. 
Skin Protection:  No special skin protection needed for normal use. 
Respiratory Protection:  No respiratory protection required for normal use. For operations 
where the dust concentration may be excessive, a dust respirator may be used.  Follow OSHA 
regulations in the selection and use of respiratory protection.

11. TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION 
Potential Health Effects:   
Acute Hazards:   
Inhalation:  Inhalation of dust may cause irritation to the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory tract. 
Skin contact:  No know skin contact effects. 
Eye contact:  Contact may cause mechanical, abrasive irritation with possible injury. 
Ingestion:  No known ingestion hazard. 
Chronic Effects:  Inhalation of excessive concentrations of any dust, including this material, may 
lead to lung injury.  This product contains crystalline silica, in the form of quartz.  Excessive 
inhalation of respirable crystalline silica may cause silicosis, a progressive, disabling and 
sometimes fatal disease of the lung.  Symptoms may include cough, shortness of breath, wheezing 
and reduced pulmonary function. 
Carcinogenicity Listing:  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), in 
Monograph 100C has concluded that crystalline silica inhaled in the form of quartz and 
cristobalite are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).  Carcinogenicity may be dependent on inherent 
characteristics of the crystalline silica or on external factors affecting its biological activity or 
distribution of its polymorphs. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) classifies crystalline silica 
as a known carcinogen. Applications and exposure data indicate that exposure to respirable quartz 
in this product with normal use is well below the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and 
ACGIH Threshold Limit Value (TLV).  The manufacturer is not aware of any scientific or medical 
data available indicating that exposure to respirable crystalline silica from this product under 
conditions of normal use will cause silicosis or cancer.  Adverse effects would not be expected from 
normal use of this product.
