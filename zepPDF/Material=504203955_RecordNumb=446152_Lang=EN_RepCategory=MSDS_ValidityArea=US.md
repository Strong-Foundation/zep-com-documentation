Suitable Extinguishing Media:
Extinguishing Media to Avoid:
Specific hazards arising from the 
chemical:
Fire Fighting:
Mist of loaded liquid, dry chemicals, carbon dioxide, fire foam, 
and dry sand are effective.
Use of straight steam of water can cause a risk of spreading 
fire.
In some cases of fire, may release irritant gases.
When burnt, may generate carbon monoxide and other toxic gases.
Spray water to the surrounding facilities for cooling.
Keep unauthorized persons off the site of occurrence of fire and 
the surroundings.
Do not induce vomiting. Drink [one glass] [two glasses] of 
water. Call a physician [or poison control
center] immediately.
Eye Contact:
Ingestion:
Rinse with clean water carefully for several minutes. Remove 
contact lenses if present and if removal is easy, then continue 
rinsing. Rinse for 15 minutes at a minimum and seek medical 
attention.
If skin irritation occurs : Get medical advice/attention.
6. Accidental release measures
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up:
Personal precautions, protective 
equipment and emergency procedures:
Environmental precautions:
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent 
inhalation of mist.
Do not touch or walk through spillage.
Pay attention to the site of spillage, which is slippery.
Prevent spreading of oil spill with earth and sand, sandbags, or 
other proper materials and use care not to allow the oil spill 
to flow to  street drains, sewer systems, and rivers.
At sea, install oil spill containment booms to prevent spreading 
of spills and absorb with absorption mat or other proper 
materials.
In case of spillage in small quantity, collect spillage by 
absorbing with earth, sand, sawdust, waste, or other proper 
materials.
Special protective equipment and 
precautions for fire fighters:
Wear protective equipment when working.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately.
Wear fire/flame resistant/retardant clothing.
Fight fire from windward direction while wearing protective 
equipment. If contact with skin is expected, wear impervious 
protective equipment and gloves.
Use air-breathing apparatus and protective clothing whenever 
necessary.

7. Handling and storage
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent 
inhalation of mist.
In case of vapor/mist dispersion, install a closed system, local 
ventilation system, and/or other proper equipment for the 
sources of vapor/mist generation
Prevention of second accident:
Keep away from any possible contact with sparks, open flames, 
and high-temperature materials, and do not allow release of 
vapor without justification.
Use pumps or other proper equipment for taking out from 
containers. Do not siphon with your mouth using a tube. Do not 
drink.
Technical Measures:
In case of spillage in large quantity, enclose with embankment 
to prevent spreading of spillage and collect spillage in empty 
containers to the extent possible.
In case of spillage, immediately inform the organizations 
concerned of the spillage to prevent possible accidents and 
spreading of spillage.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately and make 
fire-extinguishing agents available. Remove spillage completely, 
and ventilate and clean the site and the surroundings.  
Handling 
8. Exposure controls/personal protection
In case of mist generation, enclose the source of mist 
generation, or install a ventilation system.
Install eye cleaning and body cleaning equipment near the 
handling site.

from direct sunlight and keeping away from any potential 
ignition sources and high-temperature materials.
Store tightly stopped after use to prevent possible 
contamination with dust and moisture.
Preferably store locked up in a proper storage area.
Use spill-proof containers that are free of damage/corrosion.
