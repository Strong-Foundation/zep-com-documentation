General information
5. Fire-fighting measures
Not available.
Suitable extinguishing media
Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire.
Unsuitable extinguishing
media
Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may explode when exposed to heat or flame.
During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed.
Specific hazards arising from
the chemical
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with
face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA.
Special protective equipment
and precautions for firefighters
Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Containers should be cooled with
water to prevent vapor pressure build up. For massive fire in cargo area, use unmanned hose
holder or monitor nozzles, if possible. If not, withdraw and let fire burn out.
Fire fighting
equipment/instructions
Use standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials. Move
containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. In the event of fire and/or explosion do not
breathe fumes.
Specific methods
Extremely flammable aerosol.
General fire hazards
6. Accidental release measures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Wear
appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Avoid breathing gas. Do not touch
damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing. Ventilate
closed spaces before entering them. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages
cannot be contained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.
Personal precautions,
protective equipment and
emergency procedures
Refer to attached safety data sheets and/or instructions for use. Stop leak if you can do so without
risk. Move the cylinder to a safe and open area if the leak is irreparable. Use water spray to reduce
vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. Eliminate all ignition
sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Keep combustibles (wood,
paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. Prevent entry into waterways, sewer, basements or
confined areas. Following product recovery, flush area with water. For waste disposal, see section
13 of the SDS.
Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up
Avoid release to the environment. Inform appropriate managerial or supervisory personnel of all
environmental releases. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid discharge into
drains, water courses or onto the ground.

7. Handling and storage
Pressurized container:  Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Do not use if spray button is missing
or defective. Do not spray on a naked flame or any other incandescent material. Do not smoke
while using or until sprayed surface is thoroughly dry. Do not cut, weld, solder, drill, grind, or
expose containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. All equipment used when
handling the product must be grounded. Do not re-use empty containers. Avoid breathing gas.
Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Wear appropriate
personal protective equipment. Avoid release to the environment. Observe good industrial hygiene
practices.
Precautions for safe handling
Level 1 Aerosol.
Pressurized container. Protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures exceeding
50°C/122 °F. Do not puncture, incinerate or crush. Do not handle or store near an open flame,
heat or other sources of ignition. This material can accumulate static charge which may cause
spark and become an ignition source. Store away from incompatible materials (see Section 10 of
the SDS).

No biological exposure limits noted for the ingredient(s).
Biological limit values
Good general ventilation (typically 10 air changes per hour) should be used. Ventilation rates
should be matched to conditions. If applicable, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation,
or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below recommended exposure limits. If
exposure limits have not been established, maintain airborne levels to an acceptable level.
Appropriate engineering
controls
Individual protection measures, such as personal protective equipment
Face shield is recommended. Wear safety glasses with side shields (or goggles).
Eye/face protection
Skin protection
Wear appropriate chemical resistant gloves. Suitable gloves can be recommended by the glove
supplier.
Hand protection
Wear appropriate chemical resistant clothing. Use of an impervious apron is recommended.
Other
If permissible levels are exceeded use NIOSH mechanical filter / organic vapor cartridge or an
air-supplied respirator.
Respiratory protection
Wear appropriate thermal protective clothing, when necessary.
Thermal hazards
When using do not smoke. Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing
after handling the material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking.  Routinely wash work
clothing and protective equipment to remove contaminants. Contaminated work clothing should not
be allowed out of the workplace.
