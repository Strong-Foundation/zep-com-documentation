Engineering measures 
: effective ventilation in all processing areas 
 
Personal protective equipment 
Respiratory protection 
:  Use respiratory protection unless adequate local exhaust 
ventilation is provided or exposure assessment demonstrates 
that exposures are within recommended exposure guidelines. 
 
Hand protection
    Material 
:  Protective gloves 
 
    Remarks 
:  The suitability for a specific workplace should be discussed 
with the producers of the protective gloves. The use of skin 
protection is not normally required; however, good industrial 
hygiene practice suggests the use of gloves or other 
appropriate skin protection whenever working with chemicals, 
and especially if prolonged or frequent contact is possible or 
likely. 
  
 
Eye protection 
:  Tightly fitting safety goggles 
Wear face-shield and protective suit for abnormal processing
