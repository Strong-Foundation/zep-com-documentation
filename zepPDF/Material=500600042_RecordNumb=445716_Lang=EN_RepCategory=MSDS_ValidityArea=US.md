Suitable materials for short-term contact (recommended: At least protective index 2, corresponding > 
30 minutes of permeation time according to EN ISO 374-1) 
butyl rubber (butyl) - 0.7 mm coating thickness 
nitrile rubber (NBR) - 0.4 mm coating thickness 
Supplementary note: The specifications are based on tests, literature data and information of glove 
manufacturers or are derived from similar substances by analogy. Due to many conditions (e.g. 
temperature) it must be considered, that the practical usage of a chemical-protective glove in 
practice may be much shorter than the permeation time determined through testing. 
Manufacturer's directions for use should be observed because of great diversity of types.

Respiratory/Skin sensitization 
 
Assessment of sensitization: 
Skin sensitizing effects were not observed in animal studies. Human data do not fully exclude a skin 
sensitizing potential.  
 
Germ cell mutagenicity 
 
Assessment of mutagenicity: 
Based on the ingredients, there is no suspicion of a mutagenic effect.  
 
Carcinogenicity 
 
Assessment of carcinogenicity: 
The whole of the information assessable provides no indication of a carcinogenic effect.  
 
Reproductive toxicity 
 
Assessment of reproduction toxicity: 
Based on available Data, the classification criteria are not met.  
 
Developmental toxicity 
 
Assessment of teratogenicity: 
Based on available Data, the classification criteria are not met.  
 
Information on: ethanediol 
Assessment of teratogenicity: 
Developmental toxicity was observed after oral ingestion of high doses in studies with rats and mice, 
but this effect was not seen in a study with rabbits. Mechanistic studies show that the rabbit is the 
relevant species for the classification for human health. As such, and since ethylene glycol is not a 
developmental toxicant in the rabbit, no classification is warranted.
