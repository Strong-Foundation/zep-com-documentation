Advice for Firefighters 
Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.  
Firefighting Instructions: Do not breath fumes from fires or vapors from decompostion. Stop leak if safe to do so. Do not allow run-
off from fire fighting to enter drains or water sources. 
Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.  
Hazardous Combustion Products: Hydrogen chloride.  
Reference to Other Sections 
Refer to section 9 for flammability properties.  
SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures  
General Measures: Avoid all contact with skin, eyes, or clothing. Avoid breathing (vapor, mist, spray). Avoid contact with metal. 
For Non-Emergency Personnel  
Protective Equipment: Use appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE).
