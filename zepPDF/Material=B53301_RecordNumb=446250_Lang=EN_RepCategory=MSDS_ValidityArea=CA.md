4. First-aid measures
Move to fresh air. Call a physician if symptoms develop or persist.
Inhalation
No adverse effects due to skin contact are expected.
Skin contact
No specific first aid measures noted.
Eye contact
Not likely, due to the form of the product.
Ingestion
Direct contact with eyes may cause temporary irritation.
Most important
symptoms/effects, acute and
delayed
Provide general supportive measures and treat symptomatically.
Indication of immediate
medical attention and special
treatment needed
Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved, and take precautions to
protect themselves.
General information
5. Fire-fighting measures
Water spray. Water fog. Foam. Dry chemical powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2).
Suitable extinguishing media
None known.
Unsuitable extinguishing
media
Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may explode when exposed to heat or flame.
During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed.
Specific hazards arising from
the chemical
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with
face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA.
Special protective equipment
and precautions for firefighters
In case of fire: Stop leak if safe to do so. Do not move cargo or vehicle if cargo has been exposed
to heat. Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Containers should be cooled
with water to prevent vapor pressure build up. For massive fire in cargo area, use unmanned hose
holder or monitor nozzles, if possible. If not, withdraw and let fire burn out.
Fire fighting
equipment/instructions
Use standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials. Move
containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Cool containers exposed to flames with
water until well after the fire is out. In the event of fire and/or explosion do not breathe fumes.
Specific methods
Extremely flammable aerosol. Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may explode when
exposed to heat or flame.
General fire hazards
6. Accidental release measures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Keep out of
low areas. Many gases are heavier than air and will spread along ground and collect in low or
confined areas (sewers, basements, tanks). Wear appropriate protective equipment and clothing
during clean-up. Emergency personnel need self-contained breathing equipment. Do not touch
damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing. Ventilate
closed spaces before entering them. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages
cannot be contained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.
Personal precautions,
protective equipment and
emergency procedures
Refer to attached safety data sheets and/or instructions for use. Stop leak if you can do so without
risk. Move the cylinder to a safe and open area if the leak is irreparable. Use water spray to reduce
vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. Eliminate all ignition
sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Keep combustibles (wood,
paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.
Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up
Avoid discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground.
Environmental precautions
7. Handling and storage
Pressurized container:  Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Do not use if spray button is missing
or defective. Do not spray on a naked flame or any other incandescent material. Do not smoke
while using or until sprayed surface is thoroughly dry. Do not cut, weld, solder, drill, grind, or
expose containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. All equipment used when
handling the product must be grounded. Close valve after each use and when empty. Protect
cylinders from physical damage; do not drag, roll, slide, or drop. When moving cylinders, even for
short distances, use a cart (trolley, hand truck, etc.) designed to transport cylinders. Suck back of
water into the container must be prevented. Do not allow backfeed into the container. Purge air
from system before introducing gas. Use only properly specified equipment which is suitable for
this product, its supply pressure and temperature.  Contact your gas supplier if in doubt. Do not
re-use empty containers. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Wear appropriate personal protective
equipment. Observe good industrial hygiene practices.

Level 2 Aerosol.
Pressurized container. Protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures exceeding
50°C/122 °F. Do not puncture, incinerate or crush. Do not handle or store near an open flame,
heat or other sources of ignition. This material can accumulate static charge which may cause
spark and become an ignition source. Store in a well-ventilated place. Cylinders should be stored
upright, with valve protection cap in place, and firmly secured to prevent falling or being knocked
over. Stored containers should be periodically checked for general condition and leakage. Store
away from incompatible materials (see Section 10 of the SDS).
