280.12, that has been cleaned and purged or rendered inert according to the American 
Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 1604 (IBR, see 171.7 of this subchapter), then the tank and 
this material are not subject to any other requirements of this subchapter. However, sediments 
remaining in the tank that meet the definition for a hazardous material are subject to the 
applicable regulations of this subchapter.
B1 - If the material has a flash point at or above 38 C (100 F) and below 93 C (200 F), then the 
bulk packaging requirements of 173.241 of this subchapter are applicable. If the material has a 
flash point of less than 38 C (100 F), then the bulk packaging requirements of 173.242 of this 
subchapter are applicable.
IB3 - Authorized IBCs: Metal (31A, 31B and 31N); Rigid plastics (31H1 and 31H2); Composite

with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 110 kPa at 50 C (1.1 bar at 122 F), or 130 kPa at 55 
C (1.3 bar at 131 F) are authorized, except for UN2672 (also see Special Provision IP8 in Table 
2 for UN2672).
T4 - 2.65 178.274(d)(2) Normal............. 178.275(d)(3)
TP1 - The maximum degree of filling must not exceed the degree of filling determined by the 
following: Degree of filling = 97 / 1 + a (tr - tf) Where: tr is the maximum mean bulk temperature 
during transport, and tf is the temperature in degrees celsius of the liquid during filling.
TP29 - A portable tank having a minimum test pressure of 1.5 bar (150.0 kPa) may be used 
provided the calculated test pressure is 1.5 bar or less based on the MAWP of the hazardous 
materials, as defined in 178.275 of this subchapter, where the test pressure is 1.5 times the 
MAWP.
