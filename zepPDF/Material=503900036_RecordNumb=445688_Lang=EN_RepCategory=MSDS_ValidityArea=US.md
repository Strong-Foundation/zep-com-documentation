5. Fire-fighting measures 
 
Suitable extinguishing media: 
Mist of loaded liquid, dry chemicals, carbon dioxide, fire foam, 
and dry sand are effective. 
Unsuitable extinguishing media: 
Use of straight stream of water can cause a risk of spreading 
fire. 
Specific hazards arising from the 
chemical: 
In some cases of fire, may release irritant gases. 
When burnt, may generate carbon monoxide and other toxic gases. 
Specific extinguishing methods: 
Spray water to the surrounding facilities for cooling. 
Keep unauthorized persons off the site of occurrence of fire and 
the surroundings. 
Even after extinction, cool containers thoroughly with plenty of 
water. 
Special protective equipment and 
precautions for fire fighters: 
Fight fire from windward direction while wearing protective 
equipment. If contact with skin is expected, wear impervious 
protective equipment and gloves. 
Use air-breathing apparatus and protective clothing whenever 
necessary. 
Wear fire/flame resistant/retardant clothing. 
6. Accidental release measures 
 
Personal precautions, protective 
equipment and emergency 
procedures:

Do not touch or walk through spillage. 
Pay attention to the site of spillage, which is slippery. 
Environmental precautions: 
At sea, install oil spill containment booms to prevent spreading 
of spills and absorb with absorption mat or other proper 
materials. 
Prevent spreading of oil spill with earth and sand, sandbags, or 
other proper materials and use care not to allow the oil spill to 
flow to street drains, sewer systems, and rivers. 
Avoid release to the environment. 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up: 
In case of spillage in small quantity, collect spillage by 
absorbing with earth, sand, sawdust, waste, or other proper 
materials. 
In case of spillage in large quantity, enclose with embankment to 
prevent spreading of spillage and collect spillage in empty 
containers to the extent possible. 
Prevention of second accident: 
In case of spillage, immediately inform the organizations 
concerned of the spillage to prevent possible accidents and 
spreading of spillage. 
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately and make 
fire-extinguishing agents available. Remove spillage completely, 
and ventilate and clean the site and the surroundings. 
7. Handling and storage 
 
Handling 
Technical measures: 
Keep away from any possible contact with sparks, open flames, and 
high-temperature materials, and do not allow release of vapor 
without justification. 
Use pumps or other proper equipment for taking out from 
containers. Do not siphon with your mouth using a tube. Do not 
drink. 
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent 
inhalation of mist. 
In case of vapor/mist dispersion, install a closed system, local 
ventilation system, and/or other proper equipment for the sources 
of vapor/mist generation. 
Avoid rough handling of containers such as falling, dropping, 
exposing to shock, and dragging. 
Ventilation 
requirements: 
Maintain adequate ventilation when handling indoors. 
Precautions for safe 
handling: 
Avoid falling, dropping, exposing to shock, or dragging of 
containers. 
Wash hands and face thoroughly after handling. 
Be careful with fire.
