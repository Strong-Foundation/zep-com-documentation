4. First Aid Measures 
 
INHALATION:  Remove to fresh air if effects occur and seek medical attention. 
 
SKIN CONTACT:  Remove contaminated clothing. Wash all affected and exposed areas with soap and water. If irritation or 
redness develops or persists, seek medical attention. 
 
EYE CONTACT:  Exposed eyes should be immediately flushed with copious amounts of water using a steady stream for a 
minimum of 15 minutes.  If irritation, pain, swelling or tearing develop, seek medical attention. 
 
INGESTION:  If swallowed, get immediate medical advice by calling a Poison Control Center or emergency room.  If advice is 
not available, take victim and product container to the nearest emergency treatment center or hospital. Do not attempt to give 
anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
 
MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS: Eye contact may cause irritation with possible corneal injury.  May cause mild skin 
irritation or sensitization.  Harmful if absorbed through the skin. Breathing high concentrations of vapors or mists may cause 
irritation, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, loss of sense of balance and visual disturbances.  Swallowing may cause 
gastrointestinal disturbances including irritation, abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, 
drowsiness, nausea, visual disturbances, decreased urine production, malaise, unconsciousness and liver or kidney damage. 
May cause chronic effects. 
 
INDICATION OF IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION AND SPECIAL TREATMENT, IF NEEDED:  Seek immediate 
medical attention for large ingestions. 
 
NOTES TO PHYSICIAN:  This product contains a small amount of diethylene glycol. It is estimated that the lethal oral dose of 
diethylene glycol in adults is 1.0-1.2 ml/kg.  Diethylene glycol may cause an elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis and renal 
tubular injury. Liver injury may occur, but not as severe as kidney injury.  The signs and symptoms in diethylene glycol 
poisoning are those of metabolic acidosis, CNS depression and kidney injury.  Urinalysis may show albuminuria, hematuria and 
oxaluria. The current medical management of diethylene glycol poisoning includes elimination of diethylene glycol, correction 
SDS 847

of metabolic acidosis and prevention of kidney injury. It is essential to have immediate and follow-up urinalysis and clinical 
chemistry.  There should be particular emphasis on acid-base balance, and liver and kidney function tests. For severe and/or 
deteriorating cases, hemodialyis may be required.  Dialysis should be considered for patients who have severe metabolic 
acidosis, or compromise of renal function. There is no conclusive evidence that ethanol treatment will be beneficial. Consult 
your poison control center. 
 
 
5. Firefighting Measures 
 
SUITABLE EXTINGUISHING MEDIA:  Use water spray or fog, foam, carbon dioxide or dry chemical.  Cool fire exposed 
containers with water.   
 
SPECIFIC HAZARDS ARISING FROM THE CHEMICAL:  A solid stream of water or foam directed into hot, burning liquid 
can cause frothing. Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water stream to hot liquids. 
Burning may produce carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. 
 
SPECIAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PRECAUTIONS FOR FIRE FIGHERS:  Firefighters should wear positive 
pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing for fires in areas where chemicals are used or stored. 
 
6: Accidental Release Measures 
 
PERSONAL PRECAUTIONS, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:  Wear appropriate 
protective clothing and equipment (See Section 8).   
 
METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR CONTAINMENT/CLEANUP: Collect with absorbent material and place in appropriate, 
labeled container for disposal. 
 
7. Handling and Storage 
 
PRECAUTIONS FOR SAFE HANDLING: 
 
Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Wash exposed skin with soap and water after use. Avoid breathing vapors and 
mists. Use with adequate ventilation. 
 
Empty containers retain product residue and may be hazardous.  Do not cut, weld, drill, etc. containers, even empty. Do not 
reuse empty containers unless properly cleaned. 
 
CONDITIONS FOR SAFE STORAGE, INCLUDING ANY INCOMPATIBILITIES:   
Keep away from excessive heat and open flames. Keep containers closed when not in use. Do not add nitrites.  This product 
contains amines which can combine with nitrites to form nitrosamines.  Many nitrosamines have been found to cause cancer in 
laboratory animals. Store in a cool, dry area.

APPROPRIATE ENGINEERING CONTROLS:  General ventilation should be adequate for normal use.  For operations where 
the product is heated or misted and exposures may be excessive, mechanical ventilation such as local exhaust may be needed to 
minimize exposure. 
 
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
 
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: None under normal use conditions. For operations where exposures may be excessive, a 
NIOSH approved respirator with an organic vapor cartridge and a dust/mist prefilter or supplied air respirator is recommended.  
Equipment selection depends on contaminant type and concentration.  Select in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 and good 
industrial hygiene practice.  For firefighting, use self-contained breathing apparatus. 
 
GLOVES:  Impervious gloves such as PVC coated are recommended to prevent prolonged/repeated skin contact. 
 
EYE PROTECTION:  Chemical safety goggles. 
 
OTHER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT/CLOTHING:  Protective clothing if needed to avoid prolonged/repeated skin contact.  
Suitable washing and eye flushing facilities should be available in the work area.  Contaminated clothing should be removed 
and laundered or dry cleaned before re-use.

POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS: 
 
ACUTE HAZARDS: 
INHALATION:  High concentrations of vapors or mists may cause respiratory irritation experienced as nasal discomfort and 
discharge. At elevated temperatures, product may cause respiratory irritation, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, loss of 
sense of balance and visual disturbances.  High concentrations of vapors at ambient temperatures may cause lung injury, liver 
dysfunction or kidney damage. 
 
SKIN CONTACT:  Contact may cause minor irritation with redness and itching.  Prolonged or repeated exposure may cause 
drying and peeling of the skin. May cause skin sensitization in some individuals.  A single prolonged exposure is not likely to 
result in material being absorbed in harmful amounts.  Prolonged or repeated skin exposure to very large amounts may cause 
central nervous system effects. 
 
EYE CONTACT: May cause severe irritation with tearing, blurred vision and possible corneal damage.  May cause permanent 
eye damage. 
 
INGESTION:  Accidental ingestion of a small amount may cause gastrointestinal discomfort with nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea.  Large amounts may cause central nervous system effects including headache, dizziness, narcosis, slurred speech and 
blurred vision. 
 
CHRONIC EFFECTS:  Prolonged or repeated skin contact with this product may possibly lead to irritation and dermatitis. 
Prolonged or repeated inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption may lead to central nervous system effects, gastrointestinal 
disturbances and possible adverse blood, kidney, liver and reproductive effects.  Diethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether is 
slightly toxic to the fetus at doses nontoxic to the mother following skin contact. 
 
CARCINOGEN:  None of the components is listed as a carcinogen or potential carcinogen by ACGIH, IARC, NTP or OSHA.  
 
ACUTE TOXICITY VALUES: 
 
Calculated ATE for product: 
LD50: >3,333 mg/kg 
                        
 
 
LD50: >2,000 mg/kg 
 
Diethylene Glycol:  
 
LD50: Oral Rat 5,660 mg/kg  
LD50: Skin Rabbit: 2,700 mg/kg  
 
Diethylene Glycol Butyl Ether:

12. Ecological Information 
 
ECOTOXICITY: 
 
Diethylene Glycol: 96 hr LC50 Pimephales promelas 75,200 mg/L, 48 hr EC50 daphnia magna 62,630 mg/L 
Diethylene glycol monobutyl ether: 96 hr LC50 Lepomis macrochirus 1,300 mg/L, 48 hr EC50 daphnia magna >100 mg/L, 96

PERSISTENCE AND DEGRADABILITY: Diethylene Glycol: Readily biodegradable (>70% in 19days), Diethylene glycol 
monobutyl ether: Readily biodegradable (95% in 5 days). 
 
BIOACCUMULATIVE POTENTIAL:  Diethylene glycol: An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bio concentration 
in aquatic organisms is low. Diethylene glycol monobutyl ether: An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bio 
concentration in aquatic organisms is low.
