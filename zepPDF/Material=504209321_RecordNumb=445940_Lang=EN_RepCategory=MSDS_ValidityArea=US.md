4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Inhalation: 
If not breathing, give artificial respiration.  If breathing is difficult, oxygen 
should be administered by qualified personnel. Move to fresh air. If symptoms 
persist, seek medical advice.  
 
Skin contact: 
Wipe off with paper towel or cloth. Rinse with running water and soap. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Seek medical attention 
immediately. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. Thoroughly clean 
shoes before reuse.  
 
Eye contact: 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. Seek medical attention immediately.  
 
Ingestion: 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Seek medical 
attention immediately.  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media: 
Foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide. Water spray or fog.   
 
Special firefighting procedures: 
Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing, such as 
turn-out gear. Keep unnecessary personnel away.  
 
Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
Closed containers may rupture (due to build up of pressure) when exposed to 
extreme heat.  In case of fire, keep containers cool with water spray.   Do not 
allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water courses.  
 
Hazardous combustion products: 
Oxides of carbon. Oxides of silicon. Oxides of nitrogen. Toxic and irritating 
vapors. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and 
unprotected personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Do not allow product to enter sewer or waterways.  
 
Clean-up methods: 
Ensure adequate ventilation. Remove all sources of ignition. Keep 
unnecessary personnel away. Wear appropriate personal protective 
equipment. Refer to Section 8 "Exposure Controls / Personal Protection" prior 
to clean up. Scrape up spilled material and place in a closed container for 
disposal.  
 
7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling: 
Use only with adequate ventilation. Vapours should be extracted to avoid 
inhalation. Remove all sources of ignition. Prevent contact with eyes, skin and 
clothing.  Do not breathe vapor and mist.  Wash thoroughly after handling. 
Wear suitable protective clothing, safety glasses and gloves. See Section 8 of 
the SDS for Personal Protective Equipment. Keep container closed.  
 
Storage: 
Keep in a cool, well ventilated area away from heat, sparks and open flame. 
Keep container tightly closed until ready for use.  
 
For information on product shelf life, please review labels on container or check the Technical Data Sheet.

Engineering controls: 
Use local ventilation if general ventilation is insufficient to maintain vapor 
concentration below established exposure limits.  
 
Respiratory protection: 
Use NIOSH approved respirator if there is potential to exceed exposure 
limit(s).  
 
Eye/face protection: 
Safety goggles or safety glasses with side shields. Full face protection should 
be used if the potential for splashing or spraying of product exists. Safety 
showers and eye wash stations should be available.  
 
Skin protection: 
Use chemical resistant, impermeable clothing including gloves and either an 
apron or body suit to prevent skin contact.
