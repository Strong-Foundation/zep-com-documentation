Assessment of repeated dose toxicity: Repeated exposure may affect certain organs.  
 
Information on: ethylene glycol 
Assessment of repeated dose toxicity: The substance may cause damage to the kidney after 
repeated ingestion. The substance may cause damage to the kidney after repeated skin contact with 
high doses.  
---------------------------------- 
 
 
Genetic toxicity 
Assessment of mutagenicity: Based on the ingredients, there is no suspicion of a mutagenic effect.  
 
Carcinogenicity 
Assessment of carcinogenicity: The whole of the information assessable provides no indication of a 
carcinogenic effect.  
None of the components in this product at concentrations greater than 0.1% are listed by IARC; 
NTP, OSHA or ACGIH as a carcinogen.  
 
Reproductive toxicity 
Assessment of reproduction toxicity: Based on available data, the classification criteria are not met.  
 
Teratogenicity 
Assessment of teratogenicity: Indications of possible developmental toxicity/teratogenicity were seen 
in animal studies.  
 
Information on: ethylene glycol 
Assessment of teratogenicity: Developmental toxicity was observed after oral ingestion of high doses 
in studies with rats and mice, but this effect was not seen in a study with rabbits. Mechanistic studies 
show that the rabbit is the relevant species for the classification for human health. As such, and 
since ethylene glycol is not a developmental toxicant in the rabbit, no classification is warranted.  
---------------------------------- 
 
Information on: 1H-Benzotriazole, 4(or 5)-methyl-, sodium salt
