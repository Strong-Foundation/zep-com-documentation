Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters 
: Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if 
necessary. 
 
 
SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to 
local / national regulations (see section 13). 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Avoid formation of aerosol. 
Do not breathe vapours/dust. 
Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Open drum carefully as content may be under pressure. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: No smoking. 
Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated 
place. 
Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and 
kept upright to prevent leakage. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Keep away from oxidizing agents and strongly acid or alkaline 
materials. 
Do not freeze.
