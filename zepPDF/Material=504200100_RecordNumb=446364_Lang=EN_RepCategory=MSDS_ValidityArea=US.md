Rinse with clean water carefully for several minutes. Remove
contact lenses if present and if removal is easy, then continue
rinsing. Rinse for 15 minutes at a minimum and seek medical
attention.
Do not induce vomiting. Drink [one glass] [two glasses] of water.
Call a physician [or poison control
center] immediately.
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed.
6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency measures 
Use air-breathing apparatus and protective clothing whenever
necessary.
Fire fighting:
Special protective equipment and
precautions for fire fighters:
When burnt, may generate carbon monoxide and other toxic gases.
Spray water to the surrounding facilities for cooling.
Keep unauthorized persons off the site of occurrence of fire and
the surroundings.
Even after extinction, cool containers thoroughly with plenty of
water.
Wear fire resistant or flame retardant clothing.
Fight fire from windward direction while wearing protective
equipment. If contact with skin is expected, wear impervious
protective equipment and gloves.
5.3 Advice for fire-fighters
Mist of loaded liquid, dry chemicals, carbon dioxide, fire foam,
and dry sand are effective.
Use of straight stream of water can cause a risk of spreading
fire.
In some cases of fire, may release irritant gases.

6.2 Environmental precautions 
6.3 Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
6.4 Reference to other sections
Technical measures:
In case of vapor/mist dispersion, install a closed system, local
ventilation system, and/or other proper equipment for the sources
of vapor/mist generation.
Use pumps or other proper equipment for taking out from
containers. Do not siphon with your mouth using a tube. Do not
drink.
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent
inhalation of mist.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately and make
fire-extinguishing agents available. Remove spillage completely,
and ventilate and clean the site and the surroundings.
In case of spillage in large quantity, enclose with embankment to
prevent spreading of spillage and collect spillage in empty
containers to the extent possible.
In case of spillage, immediately inform the organizations
concerned of the spillage to prevent possible accidents and
spreading of spillage.
7.1 Precautions for safe handling
Keep away from any possible contact with sparks, open flames, and
high-temperature materials, and do not allow release of vapor
without justification.
Avoid release to the environment.
Prevent spreading of oil spill with earth and sand, sandbags, or
other proper materials and use care not to allow the oil spill to
flow to  street drains, sewer systems, and rivers.
At sea, install oil spill containment booms to prevent spreading
of spills and absorb with absorption mat or other proper
materials.
In case of spillage in small quantity, collect spillage by
absorbing with earth, sand, sawdust, waste, or other proper
materials.
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent
inhalation of mist.
Do not touch or walk through spillage.
Pay attention to the site of spillage, which is slippery.
Wear protective equipment when working.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately.
