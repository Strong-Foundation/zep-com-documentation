Fire fighting 
equipment/instructions 
Specific methods 
General fire hazards 
 
 
 
Alcohol resistant foam. Powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2). 
Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire. 
 
Thermal decomposition may produce smoke, oxides of carbon and lower molecular weight organic 
compounds whose composition have not been characterized. 
Self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing must be worn in case of fire. 
Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. 
Use standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials.

6. Accidental release measures 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
 
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Wear 
appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Do not breathe mist or vapor. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot be 
contained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS
Methods and materials 
for containment and 
cleaning up 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. 
 
Large Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this is 
possible. Absorb in vermiculite, dry sand or earth and place into containers. Following product 
recovery, flush area with water. 
 
Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly to 
remove residual contamination. 
 
Never return spills to original containers for re-use. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.
Environmental precautions 
Avoid discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground. 
 
 
7. Handling and storage 
 
Precautions for safe handling 
 
 
 
 
 
Conditions for safe storage, 
including any incompatibilities 
 
 
Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and 
understood. Pregnant or breastfeeding women must not handle this product. Keep away from open 
flames, hot surfaces and sources of ignition. When using do not smoke. Do not taste or swallow. Do 
not breathe mist/vapors. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Avoid prolonged exposure. 
Provide adequate ventilation. Observe good industrial hygiene practices. Wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Avoid release to the environment. 
 
Store locked up. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame. Store in a cool, dry place out of 
direct sunlight. Store in tightly closed container. Store in a well-ventilated place. Store away from 
incompatible materials (see Section 10 of the SDS).

Good general ventilation should be used. Ventilation rates should be matched to conditions. If 
applicable, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to 
maintain airborne levels below recommended exposure limits.  If engineering measures are not 
sufficient to maintain concentrations of vapors/mists below the Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL), 
suitable respiratory protection must be worn.

General hygiene 
considerations 
If contact is likely, safety glasses with side shields are recommended. 
 
 
Wear appropriate chemical resistant gloves. Full contact: Use gloves classified protection index 6 
with breakthrough time of 480 minutes. Minimum glove thickness 0.38 mm. Neoprene, butyl 
rubber, nitrile or Viton gloves are recommended. Suitable gloves can be recommended by the 
glove supplier. 
 
 
Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Use of an impervious apron is recommended. 
 
In case of insufficient ventilation, wear suitable respiratory equipment. Chemical respirator with 
organic vapor cartridge and full facepiece. If respirators are used, a program should be instituted 
to assure compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134. 
 
Wear appropriate thermal protective clothing, when necessary. 
 
Observe any medical surveillance requirements. Keep away from food and drink. Always observe 
good personal hygiene measures, such as washing after handling the material and before eating, 
drinking, and/or smoking. Routinely wash work clothing and protective equipment to remove 
contaminants.

Information on likely routes of exposure 
Inhalation 
In high concentrations, mists/vapors may irritate throat and respiratory system and cause 
coughing. 
Skin contact 
Prolonged or repeated contact may dry skin and cause irritation. 
Eye contact 
Direct contact with eyes may cause temporary irritation. 
 
Ingestion 
Harmful if swallowed. Suspected of damaging fertility or the unborn child by ingestion. May cause 
damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure by ingestion.

damage, irritation, reproductive effects, nerve damage, convulsions, edema of the lung, 
cardiopulmonary effects (metabolic acidosis), pneumonia and kidney failure which could result in 
death. The single lethal dose for humans is about 100 ml. Inhalation of high levels of vapors or 
mists for prolonged periods of time may also result in toxic effects.
