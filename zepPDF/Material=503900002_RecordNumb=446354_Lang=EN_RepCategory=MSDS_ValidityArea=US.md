General Advice
If symptoms persist, call a physician. Take a copy of the Safety Data Sheet when going for
medical treatment.
Eye Contact
Immediately flush with plenty of water. After initial flushing, remove any contact lenses and
continue flushing for at least 15 minutes. Keep eye wide open while rinsing. If eye irritation
persists: Get medical advice/attention.
Skin Contact
Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water while removing all contaminated
clothes and shoes. If skin irritation persists, call a physician. If product is injected into or
under the skin, or into any part of the body, regardless of the appearance of the wound or
its size, the individual should be evaluated immediately by a physician as a surgical
emergency.  Even though initial symptoms from high pressure injection may be minimal or
absent, early surgical treatment within the first few hours may significantly reduce the
ultimate extent of injury.
Inhalation
Move to fresh air in case of accidental inhalation of vapors. If breathing is difficult, give
oxygen. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. Call a physician immediately.
Ingestion
Do not induce vomiting without medical advice. If vomiting occurs naturally, have casualty
lean forward to reduce the risk of aspiration. If symptoms persist, call a physician.
Protection of First-aiders
Use personal protective equipment. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing.
4.2  4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed

6.2  Environmental Precautions  
Environmental Precautions
See section 12 for additional ecological information. Prevent further leakage or spillage if
safe to do so. Prevent product from entering drains. Do not allow material to contaminate
ground water system. Do not flush into surface water or sanitary sewer system. Large
Spills: Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal. Prevent entry into
waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.
6.3  Methods and material for containment and cleaning up  
Methods for Clean-up
Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth,
diatomaceus earth, vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to local /
national regulations (see section 13).
Spill Management  
LARGE SPILLS
Eliminate sources of ignition.  Prevent additional discharge of material if possible to do so
without hazard.  For small spills implement cleanup procedures; for large spills implement
cleanup procedures and, if in public area, keep public away and advise authorities.  Also, if
this product is subject to CERCLA reporting (see Section 15 Regulatory Information) notify
the National Response Center.
WATER SPILLS
Prevent liquid entering sewers, watercourses, or low areas.  Contain spilled liquid with sand
or earth.  Recover by pumping or with suitable absorbent.  If liquid is too viscous for
pumping, scrape up.  Consult an expert on disposal of recovered material and ensure
conformity to local disposal regulations.
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1. Precautions for safe handling 
Handling
Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Do not breathe vapors
or spray mist. Keep away from open flames, hot surfaces and
sources of ignition. Wear personal protective equipment. Use
personal protection recommended in Section 8. Remove and
wash contaminated clothing and gloves, including the inside,
before re-use. Should not be released into the environment.
Safe Handling Advice
Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety
practices.
7.2. Conditions for safe storage, including any 
incompatibilities 
Storage
Keep in properly labeled containers. Keep container tightly closed
in a dry and well-ventilated place.
Technical measures/Precautions
Ensure adequate ventilation. To avoid ignition of vapors by static
electricity discharge, all metal parts of the equipment must be
grounded.
Incompatible Materials and/or Coatings
No information available

8.2 Exposure controls  
Appropriate engineering controls 
Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas. Consider the potential hazards of
this material (see Section 2), applicable exposure limits, job activities, and other substances
in the work place when designing engineering controls and selecting personal protective
equipment.  If engineering controls or work practices are not adequate to prevent exposure
to harmful levels of this material, the personal protective equipment listed below is
recommended.  The user should read and understand all instructions and limitations
supplied with the equipment since protection is usually provided for a limited time or under
certain circumstances.
Personal Protective Equipment 
Eye/face protection
Safety glasses equipped with side shields are recommended as minimum protection in
industrial settings.
Skin protection
Choose the appropriate protective clothing / gloves based on the tasks being performed to
avoid exposed skin surfaces.  Glove Type:  Neoprene, Nitriles
Respiratory protection
If exposure limits are exceeded or irritation is experienced, NIOSH/MSHA approved
respiratory protection should be worn.  Positive-pressure supplied air respirators may be
required for high airborne contaminant concentrations.  Respiratory protection must be
provided in accordance with current local regulations.
General Hygiene Considerations
When using, do not eat, drink or smoke. Clean equipment, work area and clothing regularly.

12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION
12.1 Ecotoxicity 
Ecotoxicity effects
Harmful to aquatic organisms. Plants and animals may experience harmful or fatal effects
when coated with petroleum products. Petroleum-based (mineral) lubricating oils normally
will float on water. In stagnant or slow-flowing waterways, an oil layer can cover a large
surface area. As a result, this oil layer might limit or eliminate natural atmospheric oxygen
transport into the water. With time, if not removed, oxygen depletion in the waterway may
be sufficient to cause a fish kill or create an anaerobic environment.
Unknown aquatic toxicity
8.88 % of the mixture consists of component(s) of unknown hazards to the aquatic
environment
