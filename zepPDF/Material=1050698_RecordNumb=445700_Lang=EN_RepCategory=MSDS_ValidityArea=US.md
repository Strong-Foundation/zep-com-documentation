SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
Get medical attention. 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
In case of eye contact 
: Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water 
for at least 15 minutes. 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician.

application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Persons susceptible to skin sensitisation problems or asthma, 
allergies, chronic or recurrent respiratory disease should not 
be employed in any process in which this mixture is being 
used. 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
No smoking. 
Observe label precautions. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with

SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
Get medical attention. 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
In case of eye contact 
: Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids,

Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Chronic effects are delayed and symptoms may not be 
observed during an exposure. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash.

Container may be opened only under exhaust ventilation 
hood. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Persons susceptible to skin sensitisation problems or asthma, 
allergies, chronic or recurrent respiratory disease should not 
be employed in any process in which this mixture is being 
used. 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects.
