regulations. 
Always replace cap after use. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
No smoking. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards.
