General advice 
: Get medical attention immediately. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Symptoms of poisoning may appear several hours later.

Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, 
for at least 15 minutes. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Fatal in contact with skin. 
Harmful if inhaled. 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Toxic if swallowed. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
Delayed treatment may result in hypoglycemia, begin 
treatment with topical application calcium gluconate, and 
monitor blood chemistry. 
 
Contact a poison treatment specialist immediately if large 
quantities have been ingested or inhaled, or contact with large 
portions of the body have occurred.

Water spray 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Fluorine compounds 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Phosphorus compounds 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
Standard procedure for chemical fires. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters 
: Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if 
necessary. 
 
 
SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Technical measures 
: Due to the unique hazards associated with hydrogen fluoride 
(HF), it is highly recommended that emergency pre-planning 
and training of employees occur to mitigate and facilitate rapid 
response to an exposure. Facilities need to have access to 
emergency showers, proper personal protective equipment 
(PPE), a supply of calcium gluconate gel, and complete 
training of all individuals on proper PPE and procedures. 
 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Avoid formation of aerosol. 
Do not breathe vapours/dust. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes.

For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
To avoid spills during handling keep bottle on a metal tray. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: Prevent unauthorized access. 
Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated 
place. 
Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and 
kept upright to prevent leakage. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Keep away from oxidizing agents and strongly acid or alkaline 
materials.
