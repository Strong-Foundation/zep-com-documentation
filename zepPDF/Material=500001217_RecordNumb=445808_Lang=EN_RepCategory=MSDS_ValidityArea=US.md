EMERGENCY OVERVIEW
PHYSICAL APPEARANCE: Gray paste
IMMEDIATE CONCERNS: Causes irritation or damage to eyes
POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS
EYES: Corrosive to the eyes and may cause severe damage including blindness.
SKIN: Repeated or prolonged contact with skin may cause slight irritation leading to dermatitis. Product contains oximes
which are possible skin sensitizers.
SKIN ABSORPTION: MEKO: May be harmful if absorbed through the skin.
INGESTION: Small amounts should not cause injury. Swallowing large amounts may cause slight injury.
INHALATION: Overexposure to vapors may cause drowsiness may cause drowsiness, blood and liver injury, and may
irritate eyes, nose and throat.
CARCINOGENICITY: Suspected of causing cancer. [MEKO]. The following material (Crystalline silica, Titanium
dioxide) is embedded (bound) in the product and not available as respiratory dusts. When used as intended or as
supplied, the product will not pose hazards.
ROUTES OF ENTRY: Eyes, skin, inhalation, ingestion or absorption
SENSITIZATION: Sensitization possible through skin contact.
HEALTH HAZARDS: Coughing. Dermatitis. Rash. Upper respiratory tract irritation. Severe eye irritation. Symptoms
may include stinging, tearing, redness, swelling, and blurred vision. Permanent eye damage including blindness could
result. Skin irritation. May cause an allergic skin reaction.
COMMENTS: Methyl ethyl ketoxime (MEKO) is formed upon contact with water or humid air. Male rodents exposed to
MEKO vapor throughout their lifetime developed liver cancer. Additional testing is being planned by the MEKO supplier
to determine any relevance to humans. Until more data is known, exposure levels should be maintained as low as
achievable. Also, this product contains crystalline silica, fumed silica, titanium dioxide, Carbon black which are
considered a hazard by inhalation with dust. Crystalline silica is classified as an agent which is a probable carcinogen in
humans. But, this product does not fall under the dust inhalation hazard or the carcinogen classification since it does not
generate dust under normal handling conditions.
