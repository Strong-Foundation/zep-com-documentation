Section 8. Exposure controls/personal protection
Hand protection
Based on the hazard and potential for exposure, select a respirator that meets the 
appropriate standard or certification.  Respirators must be used according to a 
respiratory protection program to ensure proper fitting, training, and other important 
aspects of use.
Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be 
worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is 
necessary.  Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check 
during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties.  It should be 
noted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different 
glove manufacturers.  In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the 
protection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.
Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk 
assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,
gases or dusts.  If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless 
the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection:  safety glasses with side-
shields.
