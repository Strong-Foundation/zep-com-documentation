wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, 
for at least 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.
