Eye Contact  
Symptoms & Effects: Eye irritation, stinging sensation, tearing, redness 
Measures:  Immediately flush eyes gently with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.  While washing, 
remove contact lenses if present and easy to do so and continue rinsing.  Rinse beneath eyelids by holding 
eyelids apart with clean fingers while washing.  If eye irritation persists, seek medical attention. 
 
Ingestion  
Symptoms & Effects: Stomach or intestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness 
Measures:  Seek immediate medical attention.  If awake and alert, rinse mouth and drink plenty of water to 
help dilute the material.  Do NOT induce vomiting as this substance is an aspiration hazard.  Do not give 
liquids to a drowsy or unconscious person.  If vomiting occurs, keep heads below hips to prevent aspiration. 
 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable Extinguishing Media:  Dry chemical, Carbon dioxide, Alcohol-resistant foam 
 
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media:  None identified 
 
Hazardous Combustion Products: Carbon monoxide, Carbon dioxide 
 
Protective Equipment for Fire-Fighters:  Wear full firefighting turn-out gear (full Bunker gear), and 
respiratory protection (SCBA).   
 
Precautions for Fire-Fighters: Water may be ineffective for extinguishment, unless used under favorable 
conditions.  Material is volatile and readily gives off vapors which may travel along the ground or be moved 
by ventilation and ignited by pilot lights, flames, sparks, heaters, smoking, electric motors, static discharge or 
other ignition sources at locations near the material handling point.  Use water spray to cool fire exposed 
containers and structures if this can be done with minimal risk.  Avoid spreading burning material with water 
used for cooling purposes. 
 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Protective Equipment: Recommended to wear chemical splash goggles & gloves and discard of gloves that 
show tears, pinholes, or signs of wear.  Wear proper garments to reduce skin exposure, such as long-sleeves 
and pants. 
 
Personal Precautions: Persons not wearing proper PPE should be excluded from the area of contamination 
until clean-up has been completed.  
 
Environmental Precautions: Do not allow discharge into drains, surface waters, or sanitary sewer system.  
Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot be contained or if material discharges into 
drains or ground water.

Protective and Hygiene Measures:  Wash hands before breaks and after handling product.  When using, do 
not eat, drink, or smoke.  In case of clothes contamination, remove and wash contaminated clothing before re-
use. 
 
Eye Protection: Recommended to wear splash goggles when there is potential for the exposure of the eyes to 
the product.  Have a suitable eye wash station or bottle nearby in case of splashing into the eyes. 
 
Hand Protection: Recommended to wear gloves when using this product, and to discard of gloves that show 
tears, pinholes, or signs of wear. 
 
Skin Protection: Recommended to wear long-sleeved clothing, pants and proper foot covering in order to 
minimize direct skin contact with the product.  If skin irritation develops, contact your facility health and 
safety professional or your local safety equipment supplier to determine the proper personal protective 
equipment for your use.   
 
Respiratory Protection: Although unlikely, a NIOSH-approved air-purifying respirator with an appropriate 
cartridge and/or filter may be appropriate under certain circumstances or if overexposure has otherwise been 
determined.  Protection provided by air-purifying respirators is limited.  Use a positive pressure, air-supplied 
respirator if there is any potential for uncontrolled release or other circumstances where an air-purifying 
respirator may not provide adequate protection.
