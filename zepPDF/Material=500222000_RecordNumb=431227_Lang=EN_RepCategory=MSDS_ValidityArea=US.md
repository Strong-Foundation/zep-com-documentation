SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
 
In case of eye contact
