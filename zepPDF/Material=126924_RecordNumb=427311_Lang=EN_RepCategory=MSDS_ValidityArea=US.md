SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes.

tissue damage and blindness. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, 
for at least 15 minutes. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed

Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do NOT induce vomiting. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Chronic effects are delayed and symptoms may not be 
observed during an exposure. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated 
exposure if inhaled. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Use water spray, alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical or 
carbon dioxide. 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
Smoke 
Sulphur oxides 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must
