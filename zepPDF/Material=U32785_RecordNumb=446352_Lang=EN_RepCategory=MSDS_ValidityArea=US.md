SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
EYE CONTACT: 
If this product enters the eyes, open eyes while under gently running water. Use 
sufficient force to open eyelids. "Roll" eyes to expose more surface. Minimum flushing 
is for 15 minutes. Seek immediate medical attention. 
 
SKIN CONTACT: 
If the product contaminates the skin, immediately begin decontamination with running 
water. Minimum flushing is for 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing, taking care not 
to contaminate eyes. If skin becomes irritated and irritation persists, medical attention 
may be necessary. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse, discard contaminated shoes. 
 
INHALATION: 
After high vapor exposure, remove to fresh air. If it is suspected that fumes are still 
present, the rescuer should wear an appropriate mask or self-contained breathing 
apparatus. Keep person warm and at rest. breathing is difficult, give 
oxygen. If breathing has stopped, trained personnel should immediately begin artificial 
respiration. It may be dangerous to the person providing aid to give mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation. If unconscious, place in recovery position and get medical attention 
immediately. Maintain an open airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt 
or waistband. If the heart has stopped, trained personnel should immediately begin 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Seek immediate medical attention. In case of 
inhalation of decomposition products in a fire, symptoms may be delayed.The exposed person 
may need to be kept under medical surveillance for 48 hours. 
 
SWALLOWING: 
If swallowed, CALL PHYSICIAN OR POISON CONTROL CENTER FOR MOST CURRENT INFORMATION. If 
professional advice is not available, give two glasses of water to drink. DO NOT INDUCE 
VOMITING. Never induce vomiting or give liquids to someone who is unconscious, having 
convulsions, or unable to swallow. Seek immediate medical attention. 
 
NOTES TO PHYSICIAN: 
There is no specific antidote. Treatment of overexposure should be directed at the control 
of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient. Any material aspirated during 
vomiting may cause lung injury. Therefore, emesis should not be induced mechanically or 
pharmacologically. If it is considered necessary to evacuate the stomach contents, this 
should be done by means least likely to cause aspiration (such as: Gastric lavage after 
endotracheal intubation). 
 
Victims of chemical exposure must be taken for medical attention. Rescuers should be taken 
for medical attention, if necessary. Take a copy of label and SDS to physician or health 
professional with victim. 
 
 
SECTION 5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
FIRE & EXPLOSION PREVENTIVE MEASURES 
Not Applicable. 
 
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA 
Use dry powder, foam, carbon dioxide, water spray, halon, or any "ABC" Class extinguisher. 
 
SPECIAL FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES 
Water spray may be ineffective on fire but can protect fire-fighters 
& cool closed containers. Use fog nozzles if water is used. 
Do not enter confined fire-space without full bunker gear. 
(Helmet with face shield, bunker coats, gloves & rubber boots). 
Use NIOSH approved positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus. 
 
UNUSUAL EXPLOSION AND FIRE PROCEDURES 
Noncombustible. 
Isolate from reducers, acids, wood, organic materials, and most metals. 
Oxidizer fumes damage lungs. Symptoms may be delayed. Do not breathe fumes.

SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
SPILL AND LEAK RESPONSE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS: 
Uncontrolled releases should be responded to by trained personnel using pre-planned 
procedures. Proper protective equipment should be used. In case of a spill, clear the 
affected area, protect people, and respond with trained personnel. 
 
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
The proper personal protective equipment for incidental releases (such as: 1 Liter of the 
product released in a well-ventilated area), use impermeable gloves (triple-gloves (rubber 
gloves and nitrile gloves, over latex gloves), goggles, face shield, and appropriate body 
protection. In the event of a large release, use impermeable gloves, specific for the 
material handled, chemically resistant suit and boots, and hard hat. Self-Contained 
Breathing Apparatus or respirator may be required where engineering controls are not 
adequate or conditions for potential exposure exist. When respirators are required, select 
NIOSH/MSHA approved based on actual or potential airborne concentrations in accordance 
with latest OSHA and/or ANSI recommendations. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS: 
Stop spill at source. Construct temporary dikes of dirt, sand, or any appropriate readily 
available material to prevent spreading of the material. Close or cap valves and/or 
block or plug hole in leaking container and transfer to another container. Keep from 
entering storm sewers and ditches which lead to waterways, and if necessary, call the 
local fire or police department for immediate emergency assistance. 
 
CONTAINMENT AND CLEAN-UP MEASURES: 
Absorb spilled liquid with polypads or other suitable absorbent materials. If necessary, 
neutralize using suitable buffering material, (acid with soda ash or base with phosphoric 
acid), and test area with litmus paper to confirm neutralization. Clean up with 
non-combustible absorbent (such as: sand, soil, and so on). Shovel up and place all spill 
residue in suitable containers. dispose of at an appropriate waste disposal facility 
according to current applicable laws and regulations and product characteristics at time 
of disposal (see Section 13 - Disposal Considerations). 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
HANDLING 
Use only with adequate ventilation. Do not get in eyes, on skin or clothing. 
Wear OSHA Standard full face shield. Consult Safety Equipment Supplier. Wear goggles, 
face shield, gloves, apron & footwear impervious to material. Wash clothing before 
reuse. NEVER pour water into this substance. When dissolving or diluting, 
always add it slowly to the water. 
To minimize static discharge when transferring, ensure electrical continuity 
by bonding and grounding all equipment. Use an inlet line diameter of at 
least 3.5 inches (8.9 centimeters) with a maximum flow rate of 1 meter/second. 
 
STORAGE 
Keep separated from strong oxidants, strong acids, combustible & reducing substances, 
metals, food & feedstuffs. Keep cool. Keep dry. Keep in the dark. See: Section 10, 
<Materials to Avoid>. Do not store above 49 C/120 F. Keep container tightly closed 
& upright when not in use to prevent leakage. 
Wear full face shield, gloves & full protective clothing when opening or handling. 
When empty, drain completely, replace bungs securely. 
 
NONBULK: CONTAINERS: 
Store containers in a cool, dry location, away from direct sunlight, sources of intense 
heat, or where freezing is possible. Material should be stored in secondary containers or 
in a diked area, as appropriate. Store containers away from incompatible chemicals (see 
Section 10, Stability and Reactivity). Post warning and "NO SMOKING" signs in storage and 
use areas, as appropriate. Empty containers should be handled with care. Never store food, 
feed, or drinking water in containers which held this product. 
 
BULK CONTAINERS: 
All tanks and pipelines which contain this material must be labeled. Perform routine 
maintenance on tanks or pipelines which contain this product. Report all leaks immediately 
to the proper personnel.

A mutagen is a chemical which causes permanent changes to genetic material (DNA) such that 
the changes will propagate through generational lines. An embryotoxin is a chemical which 
causes damage to a developing embryo (such as: within the eight weeks of pregnancy in 
humans), but the damage does not propagate across generational lines. A teratogen is a 
chemical which causes damage to a developing fetus, but the damage does not propagate 
across generational lines. A reproductive toxin is any substance which interferes in any way 
with the reproductive process.
