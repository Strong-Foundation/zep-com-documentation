Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters 
: Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if 
necessary. 
 
 
SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal. 
Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms.
