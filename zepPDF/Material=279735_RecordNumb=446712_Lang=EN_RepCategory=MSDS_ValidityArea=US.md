 breathing is difficult, trained personnel should administer emergency oxygen if advised to do so by the POISON CENTER/doctor. Symptoms of pulmonary  
 edema can be delayed up to 48 hours after exposure. If direct contact during rescue breathing poses a threat to the first aid provider, “Avoid  
 mouth-to-mouth contact by using a barrier device." 
 Skin Contact: Take off immediately contaminated clothing, shoes and leather goods (e.g. watchbands, belts). Rinse skin with lukewarm, gently flowing  
 water/shower with a flushing duration of 30 minutes. Immediately call POISON CENTER/doctor. Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
 Eye Contact: Remove source of exposure or move person to fresh air. Rinse eyes cautiously with lukewarm, gently flowing water for several minutes, while  
 holding the eyelids open. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing for 30 minutes. Take care not to rinse contaminated water into  
 the unaffected eye or into the face. Immediately call a POISON CENTER/doctor. 
 Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Immediately call a POISON CENTER/doctor. If vomiting occurs naturally, lie on your side, in the  
 recovery position. 
 Most Important Symptoms and Effects, both Acute and Delayed: Causes severe skin burns and eye damage, burning of the mouth, throat, and  
 esophagus. 
 Indication of any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed: Treat symptomatically
