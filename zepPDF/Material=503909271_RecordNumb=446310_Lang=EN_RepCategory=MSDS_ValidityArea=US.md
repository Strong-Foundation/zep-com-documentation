5.3 Advice for firefighters
SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
For personal protection, see section 8. In case of spills, beware of slippery floors and surfaces.
6.2 Environmental precautions
Do NOT give sodium bicarbonate, fruit juices or vinegar. NEVER give anything by mouth if 
victim is unconscious or having convulsions. Induce vomiting only if advised by physician or 
Poison Control Center. CALL PHYSICIAN OR POISON CONTROL CENTER 
IMMEDIATELY.
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of cool water for at least 15 minutes. Do NOT permit 
victim to rub eyes. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY.
Individuals should perform only those firefighting procedures for which they have been trained. Use water spray, dry 
chemical, foam or carbon dioxide. Use water to keep fire-exposed containers cool. If a spill or leak has not ignited, use 
water spray to disperse the vapors. Water spray may be used to flush spills away from fire and diluted spills to 
noncombustible proportions(see warning on water spray on hot glycol below.)
To prevent possible storage container rupture, do not permit to freeze. Incompatible with strong acids, oxidizers, bases 
and chromium trioxide, potassium permanganate, and sodium peroxide.
Water spray may cause foaming of hot glycol so indirect application of water spray or use of other extinguishing media 
should be used on hot glycol.
The product should not be dumped in nature but collected and delivered according to agreement with the local 
authorities.
Immediately remove victim to fresh air. If victim has stopped breathing give artificial 
respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY.

SECTION 10 : STABILITY AND REACTIVITY
Handle in the presence of adequate ventilation. Engineering controls should be used 
whenever feasible to maintain concentrations below acceptable exposure criteria, 
including enclosures and local exhaust ventilation.
Where exposure is likely to exceed acceptable criteria and engineering controls are 
not feasible, use NIOSH/MSHA approved respiratory protection equipment. 
Respirators should be selected based on the form and concentration of contaminants 
in air and in accordance with OSHA (29 CFR 1910.134)
Wear gloves and protective clothing which are impervious to the product for the 
duration of exposure if there is potential for skin contact.
Wear safety glasses meeting the specifications of ANSI Standard Z87.1 where no 
contact with the eye is anticipated. Chemical safety goggles meeting the specification 
of ANSI Standard Z87.1 should be worn whenever there is the possibility of 
splashing or other contact with the eyes.

SECTION 11:TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION
11.1 Information on toxicological effects
Inhalation :
Ingestion:
Eye
Contact :
Breathing excessive levels of the vapor or mist can irritate the respiratory tract.  Excessive vapor 
concentrations of the major component (ethylene glycol), might be generated during heating of this 
material, have occasionally been reported to cause adverse effects on the blood-forming system and the 
nervous system.
Avoid concentrated strong acids, oxidizing agents and bases. Do not expose 
to open flame.
If pyrolyzed, thermal decomposition products of residue may include C, 
CO, CO2, H2O, NH3, organic vapors and nitrogen-containing.
The acute oral toxicities of the main components of this mixture are as follows :
Ethylene Glycol :
 The lowest dose reported to produce death in humans was estimated to be 1,560 mg/kg body weight;  
for a person weighing 150 pounds, this would be equivalent to drinking about three fluid ounces of 
pure ethylene glycol in a short period of time.
 Acute oral LD50's = 4,700 mg/kg (rats)
                                    5,500 mg/kg (mouse)
Diethylene Glycol
 Acute oral LD50's = 12,600 mg/kg (rat)
                                    23,700 mg/kg (mouse)
Based on the pH and irritation potential of this mixture’s constituents, the mist or liquid can be 
expected to cause mild to moderate irritation or inflammation of the eyes
