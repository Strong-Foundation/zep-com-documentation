maintain vapor exposures below recommended limits. Where 
concentrations are above recommended limits or are 
unknown, appropriate respiratory protection should be worn. 
Follow OSHA respirator regulations (29 CFR 1910.134) and 
use NIOSH/MSHA approved respirators. Protection provided 
by air purifying respirators against exposure to any hazardous 
chemical is limited. Use a positive pressure air supplied 
respirator if there is any potential for uncontrolled release, 
exposure levels are unknown, or any other circumstance 
where air purifying respirators may not provide adequate 
protection. 
 
 
Hand protection
Remarks 
:  The suitability for a specific workplace should be discussed 
with the producers of the protective gloves.  
 
Eye protection 
:  Eye wash bottle with pure water 
Tightly fitting safety goggles 
Wear face-shield and protective suit for abnormal processing 
problems. 
 
Skin and body protection 
: Impervious clothing 
Choose body protection according to the amount and 
concentration of the dangerous substance at the work place. 
 
Hygiene measures 
: When using do not eat or drink. 
When using do not smoke. 
Wash hands before breaks and at the end of workday.
