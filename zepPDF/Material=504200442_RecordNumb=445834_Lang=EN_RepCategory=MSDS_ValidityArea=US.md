Remove from further exposure.  For those providing assistance, avoid exposure to yourself or others.  Use 
adequate respiratory protection.  If respiratory irritation, dizziness, nausea, or unconsciousness occurs, seek 
immediate medical assistance.  If breathing has stopped, assist ventilation with a mechanical device or use 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
 
SKIN CONTACT 
Wash contact areas with soap and water.  If product is injected into or under the skin, or into any part of the 
body, regardless of the appearance of the wound or its size, the individual should be evaluated immediately by 
a physician as a surgical emergency. Even though initial symptoms from high pressure injection may be 
minimal or absent, early surgical treatment within the first few hours may significantly reduce the ultimate extent 
of injury. 
 
EYE CONTACT 
Flush thoroughly with water.  If irritation occurs, get medical assistance. 
 
INGESTION 
First aid is normally not required. Seek medical attention if discomfort occurs.

FIRE FIGHTING 
Fire Fighting Instructions:  Evacuate area.  Prevent runoff from fire control or dilution from entering streams, 
sewers, or drinking water supply.  Firefighters should use standard protective equipment and in enclosed 
spaces, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  Use water spray to cool fire exposed surfaces and to 
protect personnel.  
 
Unusual Fire Hazards:  Pressurized mists may form a flammable mixture. 
 
Hazardous Combustion Products:   Incomplete combustion products, Aldehydes, Smoke, Fume, Oxides of 
carbon, Sulfur oxides 
 
FLAMMABILITY PROPERTIES  
Flash Point [Method]:  >192°C  (378°F)  [ASTM D-92] 
Flammable Limits (Approximate volume % in air):   LEL:  0.9     UEL: 7.0 
Autoignition Temperature:  N/D  
 
 SECTION 6 
ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
 
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES 
In the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable 
regulations. US regulations  require reporting releases of this material to the environment which exceed the 
applicable reportable quantity or oil spills which could reach any waterway including intermittent dry creeks. The 
National Response Center can be reached at (800)424-8802. 
 
PROTECTIVE MEASURES 
Avoid contact with spilled material.  See Section 5 for fire fighting information.  See the Hazard Identification 
Section for Significant Hazards.  See Section 4 for First Aid Advice.  See Section 8 for advice on the minimum 
requirements for personal protective equipment. Additional protective measures may be necessary, depending 
on the specific circumstances and/or the expert judgment of the emergency responders. 
 
For emergency responders:  Respiratory protection: respiratory protection will be necessary only in special 
cases, e.g., formation of mists.  Half-face or full-face respirator with filter(s) for dust/organic vapor or Self 
Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) can be used depending on the size of spill and potential level of 
exposure.  If the exposure cannot be completely characterized or an oxygen deficient atmosphere is possible 
or anticipated, SCBA is recommended.  Work gloves that are resistant to hydrocarbons are recommended.  
Gloves made of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) are not water-resistant and are not suitable for emergency use.  
Chemical goggles are recommended if splashes or contact with eyes is possible.  Small spills: normal antistatic 
work clothes are usually adequate.  Large spills: full body suit of chemical resistant, antistatic material is 
recommended. 
  
SPILL MANAGEMENT 
Land Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Recover by pumping or with suitable absorbent. 
 
Water Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Confine the spill immediately with booms.  Warn other 
shipping.  Remove from the surface by skimming or with suitable absorbents.  Seek the advice of a specialist 
before using dispersants. 
 
Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this material; 
however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) wave and current direction 
and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.  For this reason, local experts should be

consulted.  Note:  Local regulations may prescribe or limit action to be taken.  
 
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS 
Large Spills:  Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal.  Prevent entry into waterways, 
sewers, basements or confined areas. 
 
 
 SECTION 7 
HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
HANDLING 
 Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard.   Material can accumulate static charges which may 
cause an electrical spark (ignition source).  When the material is handled in bulk, an electrical spark could 
ignite any flammable vapors from liquids or residues that may be present (e.g., during switch-loading 
operations).  Use proper bonding and/or ground procedures.  However, bonding and grounds may not 
eliminate the hazard from static accumulation.  Consult local applicable standards for guidance.  Additional 
references include American Petroleum Institute 2003 (Protection Against Ignitions Arising out of Static, 
Lightning and Stray Currents) or National Fire Protection Agency 77 (Recommended Practice on Static 
Electricity) or CENELEC CLC/TR 50404 (Electrostatics - Code of practice for the avoidance of hazards due to 
static electricity).     
 
Static Accumulator:   This material is a static accumulator. 
 
STORAGE 
The container choice, for example storage vessel, may effect static accumulation and dissipation.  Do not store 
in open or unlabelled containers.  Keep away from incompatible materials.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
Contains: 
Base oil severely refined:  Not carcinogenic in animal studies. Representative material passes IP-346, Modified Ames 
test, and/or other screening tests. Dermal and inhalation studies showed minimal effects; lung non-specific infiltration of 
immune cells, oil deposition and minimal granuloma formation. Not sensitizing in test animals. 
Middle distillates:  Carcinogenic in animal tests. Lifetime skin painting tests produced tumors, but the mechanism is due 
to repeated cycles of skin damage and restorative hyperplasia. This mechanism is considered unlikely in humans where 
such prolonged skin irritation would not be tolerated. Did not cause mutations In Vitro. Inhalation of vapors did not result 
in reproductive or developmental effects in laboratory animals. Inhalation of high concentrations in animals resulted in 
respiratory tract irritation, lung changes and some reduction in lung function. Non-sensitizing in test animals.
