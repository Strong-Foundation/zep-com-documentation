SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off with soap and plenty of water. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, 
for at least 15 minutes. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Overexposure may cause mild eye or skin irritation. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.
