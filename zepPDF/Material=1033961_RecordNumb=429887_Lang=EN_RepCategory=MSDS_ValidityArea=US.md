In case of skin contact 
: Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Acute specific target organ toxicity effects will differ depending 
on mode of exposure (oral, dermal, and inhalation), the 
organs and systems affected, and any preexisting medical 
conditions.   Symptoms may include respiratory difficulty, 
abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, vomiting, 
central nervous system depression, blurred vision, seizures, 
and unconsciousness - potentially life threatening. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Toxic if swallowed, in contact with skin or if inhaled.

concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal. 
Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Always replace cap after use. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 Â°C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
No smoking. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place.
