If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
 
In case of eye contact

physician or poison control center. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Causes skin irritation. 
Causes serious eye irritation. 
Harmful if inhaled. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards.
