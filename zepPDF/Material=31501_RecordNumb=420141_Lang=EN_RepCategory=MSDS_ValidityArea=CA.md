SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Remove contact lenses. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
Immediately flush eyes for at least 15 minutes. Get medical 
attention. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Causes serious eye irritation. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.

concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal.
