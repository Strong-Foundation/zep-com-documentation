not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray.  Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.   Do not eat, drink or smoke 
when using this product.   Wash thoroughly after handling.  Avoid release to the environment.   Avoid contact with 
oxidizing agents (eg. chlorine, chromic acid etc.)  Wear low static or properly grounded shoes.  Use personal protective 
equipment (gloves, respirators, etc.) as required.  To minimize the risk of ignition, determine applicable electrical 
classifications for the process using this product and select specific local exhaust ventilation equipment to avoid flammable 
vapor accumulation.  Ground/bond container and receiving equipment if there is potential for static electricity accumulation 
during transfer.

Use general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure 
Limits and/or control dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.  
Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment.
8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Eye/face protection
Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment.  The following eye/face 
protection(s) are recommended:
Full Face Shield
Indirect Vented Goggles
Skin/hand protection
Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the 
results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the 
substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. 
Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective 
clothing.  Note: Nitrile gloves may be worn over polymer laminate gloves to improve dexterity.
Gloves made from the following material(s) are recommended:  Fluoroelastomer
Polymer laminate

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.
