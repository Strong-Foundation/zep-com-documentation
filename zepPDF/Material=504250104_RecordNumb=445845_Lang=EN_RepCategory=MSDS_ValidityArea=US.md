SECTION 4: First aid measures
4.1. Description of first aid measures
General
In all cases of doubt, or when symptoms persist, seek medical attention.
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.
Inhalation
If inhaled, remove person to fresh air and keep comfortable for breathing. If breathing has stopped, give 
artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If unconscious, place in the recovery position and 
seek medical attention immediately.
Skin
In case of contact, immediately rinse skin with plenty of water. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
If skin irritation occurs, seek medical attention. Launder contaminated clothing before reuse.
Eye
In case of contact, immediately rinse eyes with plenty of fresh, clean water for at least 15 minutes. Remove 
contact lenses if present and continue rinsing. Seek medical attention immediately.

4.2. Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
No data available
4.3. Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
No data available
SECTION 5: Fire-fighting measures
5.1. Extinguishing media
Use Carbon dioxide (CO2), dry chemical, or foam to extinguish flames.
5.2. Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Hazardous Decomposition Products: May form CO and CO2.
5.3. Advice for fire-fighters
Self-contained full-face positive pressure breathing apparatus (SCBA) should be used. Water can be used 
to cool and protect exposed material. Do not allow runoff water and contaminants from fire fighting to enter 
drains or water courses.
SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
6.1. Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Avoid contact with spilled material. Use suitable personal protective equipment. Ventilate area if spilled in 
confined space or other poorly ventilated areas. Evacuate personnel to safe areas. Keep unnecessary 
personnel away.
6.2. Environmental precautions
Prevent entry into sewers and waterways. Report spills as required to appropriate authorities in 
accordance with all applicable regulations.
6.3. Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
Ventilate the area and avoid breathing vapors. Take the personal protective measures listed in section 8.
Contain and absorb spillage with non-combustible materials e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite. Place in closed 
containers outside buildings and dispose of according to the Waste Regulations. (See section 13).
Clean, preferably with a detergent. Do not use solvents.
Do not allow spills to enter drains or water courses.
If drains, sewers, streams or lakes are contaminated, inform the local water company immediately. In the 
case of contamination of rivers, streams or lakes the Environmental Protection Agency should also be 
informed. 
Dispose of in accordance with all federal, state, and local environmental regulations.
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1. Precautions for safe handling
Handling
Avoid skin and eye contact. Wash thoroughly after handling. Avoid breathing vapor. Use with adequate 
Page 3 of 12

ventilation.
In Storage
Store in a dry location at room temperature.
Keep this container and vapors from the container away from heat and flame. Keep container closed and 
maintain all original markings and labels.
7.2. Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
Keep away from strong oxidizing and reducing agents.
CAUTION!!! Do not use cutting or welding torches on drums, even when empty. Do not reuse container. 
Containers, even those that have been emptied will retain product residue and vapors. Always obey 
hazard warnings and handle empty containers as if they were full.
7.3. Specific end use(s)
There are no exposure scenarios, see details in section 1.
