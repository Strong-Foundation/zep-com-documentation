Potential Health Effects/Symptoms 
 
Inhalation: 
This product is irritating to the respiratory system. As a result of previous repeated 
overexposures or a single large dose, certain individuals will develop isocyanate sensitization 
(chemical asthma) which will cause them to react to a later exposure to isocyanate at levels 
well below the TLV. Chronic overexposure to isocyanates has been reported to cause lung 
damage. Chronic inhalation may cause liver damage. Central nervous system effects. 
Skin contact: 
This product may cause irritation to the skin. May cause skin sensitization. 
Eye contact: 
This product may cause irritation to the eyes.  
Ingestion: 
Ingestion of this product is unlikely. However, ingestion of product may produce gastrointestinal 
irritation and disturbances.
