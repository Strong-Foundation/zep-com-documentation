Disposal should be made in accordance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. Also, see Section 13.
SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1 Precautions and safe handling
- Do not expose children and pets to this material.
- After handling product, wash thoroughly with soap and water before drinking, eating, or smoking.
- Keep away from open flames.
7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
Individuals should perform only those firefighting procedures for which they have been trained. Use water spray, dry 
chemical, alcohol foam or carbon dioxide. Use water to keep fire-exposed containers cool. If a spill or leak has not 
ignited, use water spray to disperse the vapors. Water spray may be used to flush spills away from fire and diluted spills 
to noncombustible proportions(see warning on water spray on hot liquid below.)
Fire fighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus in the positive pressure mode with a full face piece when, 
there is a possibility of exposure to smoke, fumes or hazardous decomposition products. Water spray may cause foaming 
of hot glycol so indirect application of water spray or use of other extinguishing media should be used on hot liquid.
For Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures, see section 8. In case of spills, beware of 
slippery floors and surfaces.
The product should not be dumped in nature but collected and delivered according to agreement with the local 
authorities.
Soak up with inert absorbent material and dispose in accordance with local/regional/national/international regulation. 
Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal.
- Do not store at temperatures above 104 F ; Normal room temperature is satisfactory. Incompatible with strong acids, 
bases and oxidizers. and chromium trioxide, potassium permanganate, and sodium peroxide.

7.3 Specific end use(s)
The identified uses for this product are detailed in section 1.2.
SECTION 8 : EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
8.1 Control parameters
8.2 Exposure controls
Control Measures :
Handle in the presence of adequate ventilation. Engineering controls should
be used whenever feasible to maintain concentrations below acceptable
exposure criteria, including enclosures and local exhaust ventilation.
Respiratory Protection :
Where exposure is likely to exceed acceptable criteria
and engineering controls are not feasible, use NIOSH/MSHA approved
respiratory protection equipment. Respirators should be selected based on the
form and concentration of contaminants in air and in accordance with OSHA
(29 CFR 1910.134)
Protective Clothing :
Eye Protection :
Wear safety glasses meeting the specifications of ANSI Standard Z87.1 where
no contact with the eye is anticipated. Chemical safety goggles meeting the 
specification of ANSI Standard Z87.1 should be worn whenever there is the
possibility of splashing or other contact with the eyes.
