SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off with soap and plenty of water. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician.
