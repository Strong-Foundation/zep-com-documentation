SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, 
for at least 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Chronic effects are delayed and symptoms may not be 
observed during an exposure. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, coughing, 
wheezing, throat irritation, and tightness/closure of airway. 
 
Causes skin irritation. 
Causes serious eye damage. 
Suspected of causing cancer. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.

SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Alcohol-resistant foam 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Dry chemical 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains.

Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth,
