SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Symptoms of poisoning may appear several hours later. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water 
for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing 
and shoes.  Get immediate medical attention while applying 
and massaging in 2.5% calcium gluconate gel.  Wash clothing 
before reuse.  Clean shoes thoroughly before reuse.  Get 
immediate medical attention. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Rinse immediately with plenty of lukewarm water, also under 
the eyelids, for at least 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do NOT induce vomiting. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Fatal in contact with skin. 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
Delayed treatment may result in hypoglycemia, begin 
treatment with topical application calcium gluconate, and 
monitor blood chemistry. 
 
Contact a poison treatment specialist immediately if large 
quantities have been ingested or inhaled, or contact with large
