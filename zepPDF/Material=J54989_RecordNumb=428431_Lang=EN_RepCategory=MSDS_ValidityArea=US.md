SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Get medical attention immediately. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician.

If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Symptoms may differ depending on organs and systems 
affected.  These effects generally are reflected in reduced 
function or change, which may include cramping, swelling, 
respiratory issues, and general pain. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated 
exposure if inhaled.
