6.1. Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Evacuate area.   Ventilate the area with fresh air.  For large spill, or spills in confined spaces, provide mechanical ventilation 
to disperse or exhaust vapors, in accordance with good industrial hygiene practice. Warning! A motor could be an ignition 
source and could cause flammable gases or vapors in the spill area to burn or explode.  Refer to other sections of this SDS for 
information regarding physical and health hazards, respiratory protection, ventilation, and personal protective equipment.
6.2. Environmental precautions
Avoid release to the environment.   For larger spills, cover drains and build dikes to prevent entry into sewer systems or 
bodies of water.
6.3. Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
Contain spill.  Working from around the edges of the spill inward, cover with bentonite, vermiculite, or commercially 
available inorganic absorbent material.  Mix in sufficient absorbent until it appears dry.  Remember, adding an absorbent 
material does not remove a physical, health, or environmental hazard.  Collect as much of the spilled material as possible.  
Place in a closed container approved for transportation by appropriate authorities.  Clean up  residue with an appropriate 
solvent selected by a qualified and authorized person.  Ventilate the area with fresh air. Read and follow safety precautions on 
the solvent label and SDS.  Seal the container.  Dispose of collected material as soon as possible.
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1. Precautions for safe handling
For industrial or professional use only.  Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood.   Avoid 
breathing dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray.   Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.   Do not eat, drink or smoke when 
using this product.   Wash thoroughly after handling.  Contaminated work clothing should not be allowed out of the 
workplace.   Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.   Use personal protective equipment (gloves, respirators, etc.) as 
required.
7.2. Conditions for safe storage including any incompatibilities
Protect from sunlight.   Store away from heat.  Store away from acids.

Provide appropriate local exhaust ventilation for cutting, grinding, sanding or machining.
8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Eye/face protection
Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment.  The following eye/face 
protection(s) are recommended:
Indirect Vented Goggles
Skin/hand protection
Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the 
results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the 
substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. 
Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective 
clothing.
Gloves made from the following material(s) are recommended:  Polymer laminate
Respiratory protection
An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part of 
a full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following respirator
type(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:
Half facepiece or full facepiece air-purifying respirator suitable for organic vapors and particulates
For questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.

SECTION 16: Other information
NFPA Hazard Classification
Health:  3  Flammability:  2  Instability:  0  Special Hazards:  None
 
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.
 
HMIS Hazard Classification
Health: 3   Flammability: 1   Physical Hazard: 0   Personal Protection: X - See PPE section.   
Hazardous Material Identification System (HMIS® III) hazard ratings are designed to inform employees of chemical hazards 
in the workplace. These ratings are based on the inherent properties of the material under expected conditions of normal use 
and are not intended for use in emergency situations. HMIS® III ratings are to be used with a fully implemented HMIS® III 
program. HMIS® is a registered mark of the American Coatings Association (ACA).
