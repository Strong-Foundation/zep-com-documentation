 SECTION 4
FIRST AID MEASURES
INHALATION
Remove from further exposure.  For those providing assistance, avoid exposure to yourself or others.  Use 
adequate respiratory protection.  If respiratory irritation, dizziness, nausea, or unconsciousness occurs, seek 
immediate medical assistance.  If breathing has stopped, assist ventilation with a mechanical device or use 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
SKIN CONTACT
Wash contact areas with soap and water.  If product is injected into or under the skin, or into any part of the 
body, regardless of the appearance of the wound or its size, the individual should be evaluated immediately by 
a physician as a surgical emergency. Even though initial symptoms from high pressure injection may be 
minimal or absent, early surgical treatment within the first few hours may significantly reduce the ultimate extent 
of injury.
EYE CONTACT
Flush thoroughly with water.  If irritation occurs, get medical assistance.
INGESTION
First aid is normally not required. Seek medical attention if discomfort occurs.
SECTION 5
FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA
Appropriate Extinguishing Media:  Use water fog, foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide (CO2) to extinguish 
 Product Name:   MOBIL DEXRON-VI ATF
 Revision Date:  28 Nov 2017

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
flames.
Inappropriate Extinguishing Media:  Straight Streams of Water
FIRE FIGHTING
Fire Fighting Instructions:  Evacuate area.  Prevent runoff from fire control or dilution from entering 
streams, sewers, or drinking water supply.  Firefighters should use standard protective equipment and in 
enclosed spaces, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  Use water spray to cool fire exposed surfaces 
and to protect personnel.  
Hazardous Combustion Products:   Aldehydes, Incomplete combustion products, Oxides of carbon, Smoke, 
Fume, Sulfur oxides
FLAMMABILITY PROPERTIES 
Flash Point [Method]:  >180°C  (356°F)  [ASTM D-92]
Flammable Limits (Approximate volume % in air):   LEL:  0.9     
UEL: 7.0
Autoignition Temperature:  N/D 
 SECTION 6
ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES
In the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable 
regulations. US regulations  require reporting releases of this material to the environment which exceed the 
applicable reportable quantity or oil spills which could reach any waterway including intermittent dry creeks. The 
National Response Center can be reached at (800)424-8802.
PROTECTIVE MEASURES
Avoid contact with spilled material.  See Section 5 for fire fighting information.  See the Hazard Identification 
Section for Significant Hazards.  See Section 4 for First Aid Advice.  See Section 8 for advice on the minimum 
requirements for personal protective equipment. Additional protective measures may be necessary, depending 
on the specific circumstances and/or the expert judgment of the emergency responders.
 
SPILL MANAGEMENT
Land Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Recover by pumping or with suitable absorbent.
Water Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Confine the spill immediately with booms.  Warn other 
shipping.  Remove from the surface by skimming or with suitable absorbents.  Seek the advice of a specialist 
before using dispersants.
Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this material; 
however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) wave and current direction 
and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.  For this reason, local experts should be 
consulted.  Note:  Local regulations may prescribe or limit action to be taken.
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS
Large Spills:  Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal.  Prevent entry into waterways, 
sewers, basements or confined areas.

 SECTION 7
HANDLING AND STORAGE
HANDLING
 Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard. Material can accumulate static charges which may cause 
an electrical spark (ignition source).  When the material is handled in bulk, an electrical spark could ignite any 
flammable vapors from liquids or residues that may be present (e.g., during switch-loading operations).  Use 
proper bonding and/or ground procedures.  However, bonding and grounds may not eliminate the hazard from 
static accumulation.  Consult local applicable standards for guidance.  Additional references include American 
Petroleum Institute 2003 (Protection Against Ignitions Arising out of Static, Lightning and Stray Currents) or 
National Fire Protection Agency 77 (Recommended Practice on Static Electricity) or CENELEC CLC/TR 50404 
(Electrostatics - Code of practice for the avoidance of hazards due to static electricity).    
Static Accumulator:   This material is a static accumulator.
STORAGE
The  type of container used to store the material may affect static accumulation and dissipation.  Do not store 
in open or unlabelled containers.  Keep away from incompatible materials.           
 SECTION 8
EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
 
Exposure limits/standards for materials that can be formed when handling this product:  When mists/aerosols 
can occur the following are recommended:  5 mg/m³ - ACGIH TLV (inhalable fraction), 5 mg/m³ - OSHA PEL.   
NOTE: Limits/standards shown for guidance only.  Follow applicable regulations.
No biological limits allocated.
ENGINEERING CONTROLS
The level of protection and types of controls necessary will vary depending upon potential exposure conditions.  
Control measures to consider:
 No special requirements under ordinary conditions of use and with adequate ventilation.
PERSONAL PROTECTION
 
Personal protective equipment selections vary based on potential exposure conditions such as applications, 
handling practices, concentration and ventilation.  Information on the selection of protective equipment for use 
with this material, as provided below, is based upon intended, normal usage. 
Respiratory Protection:   If engineering controls do not maintain airborne contaminant concentrations at a 
level which is adequate to protect worker health, an approved respirator may be appropriate.  Respirator 
selection, use, and maintenance must be in accordance with regulatory requirements, if applicable.  Types of 
respirators to be considered for this material include:
 No special requirements under ordinary conditions of use and with adequate ventilation.
For high airborne concentrations, use an approved supplied-air respirator, operated in positive pressure mode.  
Supplied air respirators with an escape bottle may be appropriate when oxygen levels are inadequate,

gas/vapor warning properties are poor, or if air purifying filter capacity/rating may be exceeded.
Hand Protection:   Any specific glove information provided is based on published literature and glove 
manufacturer data.  Glove suitability and breakthrough time will differ depending on the specific use conditions. 
Contact the glove manufacturer for specific advice on glove selection and breakthrough times for your use 
conditions. Inspect and replace worn or damaged gloves. The types of gloves to be considered for this material 
include:
 No protection is ordinarily required under normal conditions of use.
Eye Protection:   If contact is likely, safety glasses with side shields are recommended.
Skin and Body Protection:    Any specific clothing information provided is based on published literature or 
manufacturer data.  The types of clothing to be considered for this material include:
 No skin protection is ordinarily required under normal conditions of use.  In accordance with good 
industrial hygiene practices, precautions should be taken to avoid skin contact.
Specific Hygiene Measures:   Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing after 
handling the material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking.  Routinely wash work clothing and 
protective equipment to remove contaminants.  Discard contaminated clothing and footwear that cannot be 
cleaned. Practice good housekeeping.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS
