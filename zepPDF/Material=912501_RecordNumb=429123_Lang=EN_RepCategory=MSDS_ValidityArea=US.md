Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Water spray jet 
Alcohol-resistant foam 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Dry chemical 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters 
: Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if 
necessary. 
 
 
SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, 
acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). 
Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable 
container for disposal.
