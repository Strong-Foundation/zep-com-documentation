For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Open drum carefully as content may be under pressure. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Persons susceptible to skin sensitisation problems or asthma, 
allergies, chronic or recurrent respiratory disease should not 
be employed in any process in which this mixture is being 
used.
