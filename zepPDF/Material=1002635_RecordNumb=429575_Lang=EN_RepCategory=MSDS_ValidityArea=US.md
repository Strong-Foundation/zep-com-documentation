SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Symptoms of poisoning may appear several hours later. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do NOT induce vomiting. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Acute specific target organ toxicity effects will differ depending 
on mode of exposure (oral, dermal, and inhalation), the 
organs and systems affected, and any preexisting medical 
conditions.   Symptoms may include respiratory difficulty, 
abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, vomiting, 
central nervous system depression, blurred vision, seizures, 
and unconsciousness - potentially life threatening. 
Symptoms may differ depending on organs and systems 
affected.  These effects generally are reflected in reduced 
function or change, which may include cramping, swelling, 
respiratory issues, and general pain. 
Aspiration may cause pulmonary oedema and pneumonitis. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
May be fatal if swallowed and enters airways. 
Causes skin irritation. 
Causes serious eye damage. 
May cause damage to organs.
