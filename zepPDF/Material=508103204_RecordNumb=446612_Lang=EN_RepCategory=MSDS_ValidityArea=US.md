Section 6. Accidental release measures
Environmental precautions
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Stop leak if without risk.  Move containers from spill area.  Approach release from 
upwind.  Prevent entry into sewers, water courses, basements or confined areas.
Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible, absorbent material e.g. sand, earth,
vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and place in container for disposal according to local 
regulations.  Contaminated absorbent material may pose the same hazard as the spilled 
product.  Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor.
No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training.
Evacuate surrounding areas.  Keep unnecessary and unprotected personnel from 
entering.  Do not touch or walk through spilled material.  Avoid breathing vapor or mist.
Provide adequate ventilation.  Put on appropriate personal protective equipment.  Floors 
may be slippery; use care to avoid falling.  Contact emergency personnel.
Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains 
and sewers.  Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental 
pollution (sewers, waterways, soil or air).
Large spill
Stop leak if without risk.  Move containers from spill area.  Absorb with an inert material 
and place in an appropriate waste disposal container.  Dispose of via a licensed waste 
disposal contractor.
Small spill
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up
For non-emergency 
personnel
For emergency responders
Entry into a confined space or poorly ventilated area contaminated with vapor, mist or 
fume is extremely hazardous without the correct respiratory protective equipment and a 
safe system of work.  Wear self-contained breathing apparatus.  Wear a suitable 
chemical protective suit.  Chemical resistant boots.  See also the information in "For non-
emergency personnel".
Section 7. Handling and storage
Advice on general 
occupational hygiene
Conditions for safe storage,
including any 
incompatibilities
Eating, drinking and smoking should be prohibited in areas where this material is 
handled, stored and processed.  Wash thoroughly after handling.  Remove contaminated 
clothing and protective equipment before entering eating areas.  See also Section 8 for 
additional information on hygiene measures.
Store in accordance with local regulations.  Store in original container protected from 
direct sunlight in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area, away from incompatible materials 
(see Section 10) and food and drink.  Keep container tightly closed and sealed until 
ready for use.  Store and use only in equipment/containers designed for use with this 
product.  Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright 
to prevent leakage.  Do not store in unlabeled containers.  Use appropriate containment 
to avoid environmental contamination.  DO NOT ADD NITRITES TO THIS FLUID.
Protective measures
Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (see Section 8).  Avoid contact with 
eyes, skin and clothing.  Do not ingest.  Empty containers retain product residue and can 
be hazardous.  Keep in the original container or an approved alternative made from a 
compatible material, kept tightly closed when not in use.  Do not reuse container.  Do not 
breathe vapor or mist.

Section 8. Exposure controls/personal protection
Ingredient name
Exposure limits
Hand protection
Wear protective gloves if prolonged or repeated contact is likely.  Wear chemical 
resistant gloves.  Recommended: Butyl gloves.  Neoprene gloves.  The correct choice of 
protective gloves depends upon the chemicals being handled, the conditions of work and 
use, and the condition of the gloves (even the best chemically resistant glove will break 
down after repeated chemical exposures). Most gloves provide only a short time of 
protection before they must be discarded and replaced.  Because specific work 
environments and material handling practices vary, safety procedures should be 
developed for each intended application. Gloves should therefore be chosen in 
consultation with the supplier/manufacturer and with a full assessment of the working 
conditions.
Safety glasses with side shields.
Eye/face protection
Body protection
Use of protective clothing is good industrial practice.  Cotton or polyester/cotton overalls 
will only provide protection against light superficial contamination that will not soak 
through to the skin.  Overalls should be laundered on a regular basis.  When the risk of 
skin exposure is high (e.g. when cleaning up spillages or if there is a risk of splashing)
then chemical resistant aprons and/or impervious chemical suits and boots will be 
required.  Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the 
task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist 
before handling this product.
Environmental exposure 
controls
Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure they 
comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation.  In some cases,
fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will be 
necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.
Appropriate engineering 
controls
All activities involving chemicals should be assessed for their risks to health, to ensure 
exposures are adequately controlled. Personal protective equipment should only be 
considered after other forms of control measures (e.g. engineering controls) have been 
suitably evaluated.  Personal protective equipment should conform to appropriate 
standards, be suitable for use, be kept in good condition and properly maintained.
Your supplier of personal protective equipment should be consulted for advice on 
selection and appropriate standards.  For further information contact your national 
organisation for standards.
Provide exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls to keep the relevant airborne 
concentrations below their respective occupational exposure limits.
The final choice of protective equipment will depend upon a risk assessment. It is 
important to ensure that all items of personal protective equipment are compatible.
Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before 
eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.
Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.
Wash contaminated clothing before reusing.  Ensure that eyewash stations and safety 
showers are close to the workstation location.

Individual protection measures

Skin protection
Other skin protection
Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected 
based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a 
specialist before handling this product.
Consult your supervisor or Standard Operating Procedure (S.O.P) for special handling 
instructions.
While specific OELs for certain components may be shown in this section, other components may be present in any mist,
vapor or dust produced. Therefore, the specific OELs may not be applicable to the product as a whole and are provided

Section 8. Exposure controls/personal protection
In case of insufficient ventilation, wear suitable respiratory equipment.
The correct choice of respiratory protection depends upon the chemicals being handled,
the conditions of work and use, and the condition of the respiratory equipment. Safety 
procedures should be developed for each intended application. Respiratory protection 
equipment should therefore be chosen in consultation with the supplier/manufacturer 
and with a full assessment of the working conditions.
