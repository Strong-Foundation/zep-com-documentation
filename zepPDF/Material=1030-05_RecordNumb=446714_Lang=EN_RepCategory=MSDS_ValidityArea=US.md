SECTION 4: FIRST-AID MEASURES
4.1
Description of necessary measures:
Request medical assistance immediately, showing the SDS of this product.
By inhalation:
Remove the person affected from the area of exposure, provide with fresh air and keep at rest. In serious cases such as
cardiorespiratory failure, artificial resuscitation techniques will be necessary (mouth to mouth resuscitation, cardiac massage,
oxygen supply, etc.) requiring immediate medical assistance.
By skin contact:
Remove contaminated clothing and footwear, rinse skin or shower the person affected if appropriate with plenty of cold water and
neutral soap. In serious cases see a doctor. If the product causes burns or freezing, clothing should not be removed as this could
worsen the injury caused if it is stuck to the skin. If blisters form on the skin, these should never be burst as this will increase the
risk of infection.
By eye contact:
Rinse eyes thoroughly with lukewarm water for at least 15 minutes. Do not allow the person affected to rub or close their eyes. If
the injured person uses contact lenses, these should be removed unless they are stuck to the eyes, as this could cause further
damage. In all cases, after cleaning, a doctor should be consulted as quickly as possible with the SDS of the product.
By ingestion/aspiration:
Request immediate medical assistance, showing the SDS of this product. Do not induce vomiting, because its expulsion from the
stomach can be hazardous to the mucus of the main digestive tract, and its inhalation, to the respiratory system. Rinse out the
mouth and throat, as they may have been affected during ingestion. In the case of loss of consciousness do not administrate
anything orally unless supervised by a doctor. Keep the person affected at rest.
4.2
Most important symptoms/effects, acute and delayed:
Acute and delayed effects are indicated in sections 2 and 11.
4.3
Indication of immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary:
Non-applicable
SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES
5.1
Suitable (and unsuitable) extinguishing media:
Product is non-flammable under normal conditions of storage, manipulation and use. In the case of inflammation as a result of
improper manipulation, storage or use preferably use polyvalent powder extinguishers (ABC powder), in accordance with the
Regulation on fire protection systems. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED to use tap water as an extinguishing agent.
5.2
Specific hazards arising from the chemical:

according to 29 CFR 1910.1200
SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES (continued)
As a result of combustion or thermal decomposition reactive sub-products are created that can become highly toxic and,
consequently, can present a serious health risk.
5.3
Special protective equipment and precautions for fire-fighters:
Depending on the magnitude of the fire it may be necessary to use full protective clothing and individual respiratory equipment.
Minimum emergency facilities and equipment should be available (fire blankets, portable first aid kit,...)
Additional provisions:
As in any fire, prevent human exposure to fire, smoke, fumes or products of combustion. Only properly trained personnel should
be involved in firefighting. Evacuate nonessential personnel from the fire area. Destroy any source of ignition. In case of fire,
refrigerate the storage containers and tanks for products susceptible to inflammation. Avoid spillage of the products used to
extinguish the fire into an aqueous medium.
SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
6.1
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures:
Sweep up and shovel product or other means and place in container for reuse (preferred) or disposal
6.2
Environmental precautions:
The characteristic of corrosivity per RCRA could apply to the unused product if it becomes a waste material. The EPA hazardous
waste number D002 could apply. It is the responsibility of the waste generator to evaluate whether his wastes are hazardous by
characteristics or listing.
6.3
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up:
It is recommended:
Sweep up and shovel product or other means and place in container for reuse (preferred) or disposal
