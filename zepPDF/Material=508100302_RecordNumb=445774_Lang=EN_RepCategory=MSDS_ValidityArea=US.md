Section 4: First-Aid Measures 
Primary Routes of Exposure: 
Inhalation:   Remove to fresh air. If symptoms develop, seek immediate medical attention. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. 
Eye Contact:  Flush eyes with water for 15 minutes. If irritation develops, consult a physician. 
Skin Contact: Wash affected area with soap and water and rinse thoroughly. If irritation develops, consult a physician.  
Ingestion: Give water. Call a physician immediately. Do not induce vomiting. 
Aggravation of Existing Conditions: Exposure to this product is not expected to contribute to, worsen or aggravate any existing medical 
conditions. 
 
Most Important Symptom: Treat symptomatically. 
 
Section 5: Fire-Fighting Measures 
Extinguishing Media: Based on the NFPA guide, use dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water mist, water jet sprays, halogen, or alcohol 
foam suitable for Class B fires. Use water to cool containers exposed to fire. For large fires, use water spray, fog or alcohol foam, 
thoroughly drenching the burning material.   
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: High volume water with full jet.  Oxidizers and reducers. 
Unusual Fire and Hazardous Combustion and Decomposition Products: Smoke, soot, and toxic/irritating fumes (i.e., carbon dioxide, 
carbon monoxide, etc.). Oxides of phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon. 
Fire and Explosion Hazards: May liberate irritating or toxic vapors during combustion or decomposition.   
Fire-Fighting Procedures/Equipment: Fire fighters and others who may be exposed to the products of combustion should be equipped 
with NIOSH-approved, positive-pressure, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and full protective clothing.  Water can be used 
to cool and protect containers and surroundings. 
 
Section 6: Accidental Release Measures 
Non-Emergency Personnel: 
General Advice: Avoid inhalation and contact with skin, eyes, or clothing.  Wash hands and face before eating, drinking, or using 
tobacco products.  
Personal Protective Equipment Needed: Wear impervious gloves, shoes, and protective clothing 
Emergency Personnel: 
Suitable Protective Gear: Wear impervious gloves, shoes and protective clothing. 
Unsuitable Protective Gear: Not Applicable 
Environmental Precautions: Prevent any contamination of local soils and water supply.  Prevent ground water infiltration or any 
ground penetration. Avoid the spreading or entering into watercourses by using sand, soil, or other types of barriers.  If contamination 
into water course or sewage system, alert appropriate authorities. 
Containment/Clean-up Methods: 
Containment & Recovery of Product: Contain with absorbent material, such as clay, soil, universal binding medium, or any 
commercially available absorbent. Shovel reclaimed dye and absorbent into a recovery or salvage drums for disposal. For larger spills, 
transfer to a salvage tank for recovery or safe disposal.  Any residues should be treated like a small spill.  This is not a RCRA hazardous 
waste per Title 40 CFR 261.   Stop material from contaminating soil, or from entering sewers or bodies of water. For larger spills, 
transfer to a salvage tank for safe recovery/disposal. Residues are treated as small spills. 
Disposal: Either incinerate or land fill in accordance with applicable local, state and federal regulations. 
 
Section 7: Handling and Storage 
Handling Precautions: Use product only in well ventilated areas.  Avoid breathing in mists or vapors from a heated product.  Avoid 
formation of mists.  Avoid heating product near flash point.  Avoid prolonged or repeated contact with skin.  Handle in ambient 
temperature. 
Storage Conditions: Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area away from heat, ignition sources, and direct sunlight. Always keep 
containers tightly closed. Store away from oxidizing and reducing agents.  
Personal Hygiene: Wash hands before breaks and at the end of the workday.  Do not carry cleaning clothes used to absorb product in 
clothing.  General hygiene measures for chemicals apply.  
Empty Container Precautions: Do not reuse empty container for any purpose.

Version 1 
Engineering Controls/Ventilation: Maintain airborne concentrations below the established exposure limits by providing adequate 
ventilation. General (dilution) ventilation should be acceptable. Additional local exhaust ventilation is recommended where dusts, 
mists or vapors may be released.   
Personal Protective Equipment: 
Respiratory Protection: Avoid breathing vapor and/or mist. If occupational exposure limits are exceeded wear NIOSH/OSHA approved 
equipment.  Use a respiratory protection fitted with a combination filter A-P3 for short term use. High airborne concentrations may 
necessitate the use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or a supplied air respirator. Respiratory protection programs must 
be in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.134. 
Skin Protection: Wear protective clothing and appropriate impervious gloves.  butyl-rubber  
Eye Protection: Wear safety goggles with peripheral coverage approved to EU Standard EN 166, AS/NZS 1337. An eye wash facility 
should be readily available.   
Hand Protection: When in contact with material, be sure to use proper gloves approved to standards (Europe: EN 374, U.S.: F739, & 
AS/NZS: 2161).   Gloves made from neoprene, nitrile or butyl rubber may provide suitable chemical protection. 
Hygiene Measures: Wash thoroughly after handling, especially before eating, drinking, smoking, or using restroom facilities.
