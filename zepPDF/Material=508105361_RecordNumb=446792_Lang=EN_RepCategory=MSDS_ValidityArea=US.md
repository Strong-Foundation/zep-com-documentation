4. First-aid measures
If breathing is difficult, remove to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing.
If breathing stops, provide artificial respiration. It may be dangerous to the person providing aid to
give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Call a physician if symptoms develop or persist.
Inhalation
Wash off with plenty of water. Remove and isolate contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical
attention if irritation develops and persists. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.
Skin contact
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if
present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Get medical attention if irritation develops and persists.
Eye contact
Rinse mouth. If material has been swallowed and the exposed person is conscious, give small
quantities of water to drink. Never give anything by mouth to a victim who is unconscious or is
having convulsions. Do not induce vomiting without advice from poison control center. If vomiting
occurs, keep head low so that stomach content doesn't get into the lungs. Maintain an open
airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband. Get medical attention if
symptoms occur.
Ingestion
May cause eye irritation. Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause irritation.
Most important
symptoms/effects, acute and
delayed
Provide general supportive measures and treat symptomatically. If ingestion of a large amount
does occur, call a poison control center immediately.
Indication of immediate
medical attention and special
treatment needed
Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved, and take precautions to
protect themselves.
General information
5. Fire-fighting measures
Dry chemical powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2). Foam. Water fog. Water spray.
Suitable extinguishing media
None known.
Unsuitable extinguishing
media
During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed.
Specific hazards arising from
the chemical
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with
face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA.
Special protective equipment
and precautions for firefighters
Fire-fighting
equipment/instructions
Cool containers exposed to heat with water spray and remove container, if no risk is involved.
No unusual fire or explosion hazards noted.
General fire hazards
6. Accidental release measures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Wear
appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Do not touch damaged containers
or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing. Ensure adequate ventilation.
Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot be contained. For personal
protection, see section 8 of the SDS.
Personal precautions,
protective equipment and
emergency procedures
The product is immiscible with water and will spread on the water surface. Prevent product from
entering drains.
Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Avoid dust formation. Sweep up
or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable container for disposal. Clean surface thoroughly to
remove residual contamination.
Never return spills to original containers for re-use. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.
Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up
Avoid release to the environment. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid
discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground. Inform appropriate managerial or
supervisory personnel of all environmental releases.

7. Handling and storage
Provide adequate ventilation. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Avoid prolonged
exposure. When using, do not eat, drink or smoke. Wear appropriate personal protective
equipment. Observe good industrial hygiene practices. Avoid release to the environment. Use care
in handling/storage. For product usage instructions, please see the product label.
Precautions for safe handling
Keep containers tightly closed in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. Do not store in direct
sunlight. Store away from incompatible materials (see Section 10 of the SDS).
Conditions for safe storage,
including any incompatibilities
8. Exposure controls/personal protection
No exposure limits noted for ingredient(s).
Occupational exposure limits
No biological exposure limits noted for the ingredient(s).
Biological limit values
Good general ventilation (typically 10 air changes per hour) should be used. Ventilation rates
should be matched to conditions. If applicable, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation,
or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below recommended exposure limits. If
exposure limits have not been established, maintain airborne levels to an acceptable level. Eye
wash facilities and emergency shower must be available when handling this product.
Appropriate engineering
controls
Individual protection measures, such as personal protective equipment
Wear safety glasses with side shields (or goggles).
Eye/face protection
Skin protection
Wear protective gloves such as: Neoprene. Nitrile.
Hand protection
Wear suitable protective clothing.
Other
If engineering controls are not feasible or if exposure exceeds the applicable exposure limits, use a
NIOSH-approved cartridge respirator with an organic vapor cartridge. Use a self-contained
breathing apparatus in confined spaces and for emergencies. Air monitoring is needed to
determine actual employee exposure levels.
Respiratory protection
Wear appropriate thermal protective clothing, when necessary.
Thermal hazards
Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing after handling the material
and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking.  Routinely wash work clothing and protective
equipment to remove contaminants.
