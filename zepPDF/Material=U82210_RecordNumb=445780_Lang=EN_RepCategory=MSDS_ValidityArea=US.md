FIRST AID MEASURES
First Aid - Eyes:
In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. Get medical attention, if irritation develops. 
First Aid - Skin:
In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of soap and water for at least 
15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.  Get medical 
attention immediately if irritation or rash develops and/or persists.  Wash 
contaminated clothing before reuse.
First Aid - Ingestion:
If swallowed and feel unwell, call a physician or poison control center.  DO NOT 
induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a physician or poison control center.  If
victim is fully conscious, give a cupful of water.  Never give anything by mouth to 
an unconscious person.
First Aid - Inhalation:
If respiratory symptoms or other symptoms of exposure develop, move victim away
from source of exposure and into fresh air.  If symptoms persist, seek immediate 
medical attention.  If victim is not breathing, clear airway and immediately begin 
artificial respiration.  If breathing difficulties develop, oxygen should be 
administered by qualified personnel.  Seek immediate medical attention.
Important Symptoms /
Effects – Acute and 
Delayed:
Tissue inflammation, skin/tissue ulceration or burns, nausea, difficulty breathing.
Advice to Physician:
Treat symptomatically.
SECTION 5
FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Extinguishing Media:
Treat surrounding material.  Water spray, dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or
