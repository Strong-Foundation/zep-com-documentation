2. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION
Potential Acute Health Effects:
Eye Contact: Causes severe eye burns. Small quantities can result in permanent damage and/or loss of vision.
Skin Contact: Causes severe burns. Corrosive action causes burns and frequently deep ulcerations with subsequent
scarring. Prolonged contact destroys tissue. May cause dermatitis.
Inhalation: Corrosive to the respiratory passage. Inhalation of dusts or mists can cause damage to the upper respiratory
tract and to the lung tissue depending on severity of exposure. Effects can range from mild irritation of mucous
membranes, severe pneumonitis and destruction of lung tissue.
Ingestion: Ingestion can cause damage to the mucous membranes, mouth and digestive system. Ingestion of product
may result in death.

4. FIRST AID MEASURES
Eye Contact: Utmost speed is essential. Flush eyes with gently flowing water for 15-30 minutes, while holding the
eyelid(s) open. Take care not to rinse the contaminated water into the unaffected eye or face. Seek immediate medical
attention. Have an ophthalmologist make an evaluation of eye injury.
Skin Contact: Flush affected skin with gently flowing water for 15-30 minutes and remove contaminated clothing while
rinsing. If wearing goggles, flush head and face thoroughly before removing goggles. Obtain medical attention
immediately.
Inhalation: If symptoms are experienced, remove source of contamination or move victim to fresh air. If symptoms
persist, get medical attention. If breathing has stopped, trained personnel should begin artificial respiration (AR)
immediately. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. In situations where administering oxygen is appropriate, first aiders
must be trained in the safe use and handling of oxygen. It is preferable to administer oxygen under a doctor's supervision
or advice. If the heart has stopped, trained personnel should begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately.
Immediate medical assistance is required.
Ingestion: Gently wipe or rinse the inside of the mouth with water. Do not induce vomiting. Seek immediate medical
attention. Administer artificial respiration if breathing has stopped. If the heart has stopped, trained personnel should
begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately. Never give anything by mouth if victim is rapidly losing
consciousness, unconscious or convulsing.
Notes to Physician: Treatment based on sound judgment of physician and individual reactions of patient.
5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Flash Point: None.
Flash Point Method: Not applicable.
Autoignition Temperature: Not available.
Flammable Limits in Air (%): Not Available.
Extinguishing Media: Not flammable. Use extinguishing media appropriate for surrounding fire.
Special Exposure Hazards: Contact with some metals (particularly magnesium, aluminum and galvanized zinc) can
rapidly generate hydrogen. Use water spray to cool containers. Do not get water inside container. Avoid direct contact of
this product with water as this can cause a violent exothermic reaction.
Hazardous Decomposition/Combustion Materials (under fire conditions): Oxides of sodium.
Special Protective Equipment: Fire fighters should wear full protective clothing, including self-contained breathing
equipment.
NFPA RATINGS FOR THIS PRODUCT ARE: HEALTH 3, FLAMMABILITY 0, INSTABILITY 1
HMIS RATINGS FOR THIS PRODUCT ARE: HEALTH  3, FLAMMABILITY  0, REACTIVITY  1
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Personal Precautionary Measures: Wear appropriate protective equipment.
Environmental Precautionary Measures: Prevent from entering into soil, ditches, sewers, waterways and/or
groundwater. Consult local authorities.
Procedure for Clean Up: Scoop up or vacuum up and place in an appropriate closed container. Avoid raising dust.
Isolate spill and stop leak where safe. If the material has been mixed with water or any other liquid, then dike area to
contain spill. Dilute spill with large amounts of water and neutralize with dilute acid. Use vacuum truck to pick up
neutralized material for proper disposal. Flush area with water to remove trace residue.

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
Handling: For food plant and other industrial use only. Handle and open containers with care. Never touch eyes of face
with hands or gloves that may be contaminated with this product. Do not ingest. Avoid inhalation of chemical. Empty
containers may contain hazardous product residues.  Keep the containers closed when not in use.  Protect against
physical damage. Use appropriate personnel protective equipment. CAUTION - Do not add water to caustic soda beads.
The proper way is to add the beads slowly to the surface of cold water and agitate while they dissolve to avoid violent
eruption or explosive reaction. If the water is not agitated, adding caustic soda beads rapidly is dangerous. The danger is
greater if the water is warm instead of cold. The high heat of solution of dry caustic soda may cause a sudden violent
eruption of caustic solution. Also, a layer of concentrated solution may form and suddenly mix with a layer of less
concentrated solution. In this case, the high heat of solution may create steam and cause the solution to erupt. Caustic
soda reacts with magnesium, aluminum, zinc (galvanized), tin, chromium, brass and bronze, generating hydrogen which
is explosive. Caustic soda may react with various sugars to generate carbon monoxide. Hazardous carbon monoxide gas
can form upon contact with food and beverage products in enclosed vessels and can cause death. Do not enter a storage
tank or container (truck or rail) that has contained this product, even if it appears empty.
Storage: Store in a dry, well ventilated area, separate from acids, peroxides, metals, easily ignitable materials and other
incompatibles. Protect against moisture, water and physical damage. Do not store in aluminum container or use
aluminum fittings or transfer lines, as flammable hydrogen can be generated.
8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
Engineering Controls:
Provide local exhaust to meet TLV requirements if making solutions or grinding up and mist or dust is generated.
Ventilation facilities should be corrosion resistant. Localized ventilation should be used to control dust levels.
Respiratory Protection: If exposure exceeds occupational exposure limits, use an appropriate NIOSH approved
respirator. In case of spill or leak resulting in unknown concentration, use a NIOSH approved supplied air respirator.
Gloves:
Appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn. Nitrile gloves. Neoprene gloves.
Skin Protection: Skin contact should be prevented through the use of suitable protective clothing, gloves and footwear,
selected for conditions of use and exposure potential. Consideration must be given both to durability as well as
permeation resistance. PVC clothing. Rubber apron. Rubber boots.
Eyes: Close fitting chemical safety goggles with faceshield.
Other Personal Protection Data: Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are proximal to the work-station
location.
