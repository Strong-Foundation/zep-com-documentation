Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures 
Personal Precautions 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8. Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in 
confined areas. 
For emergency responders 
Isolate area. Keep unnecessary personnel away. 
Environment Precautions 
Environmental Precautions 
Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. See Section 12 for additional 
ecological information. 
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up 
Methods for containment 
 Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, vermiculite) and place in container 
for disposal according to local/national regulations (See Section 13). 
Methods for cleaning up 
 Use clean non-sparking tools to collect absorbed material. May be ignited by friction, heat, sparks or 
flames. Collect spillage. Soak up with inert absorbent material,. Sweep up and shovel into suitable 
containers for disposal. Following product recovery, flush area with water. 
Precautions for Safe Handling 
Advice on Safe Handling 
 Keep away from heat sparks, flame and other sources of ignition (i.e., pilot lights, electric motors and 
static electricity). Take precautionary measures against static discharges. Do not eat, drink or smoke 
when using this product. Use personal protection recommended in Section 8. Avoid contact with skin, 
eyes or clothing. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Avoid breathing vapors or mists. Wash thoroughly 
after handling. Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice. 
Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities 
Storage Conditions 
Incompatible materials 
Keep Containers tightly closed in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. Keep from freezing. Keep 
away from heat, sparks, flame and other sources of ignition(i.e., pilot lights, electric motors and 
static electricity). Store between 40 to 100˚F. 
Heat, sparks, open flame, other ignition sources. Reacts violently with strong oxidants such as nitric acid and 
silver nitrate causing fire and explosion hazard. Reacts slowly with calcium hypochlorite and ammonia causing 
fire and explosion hazard.
