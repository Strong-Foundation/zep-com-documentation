5.3. Special protective actions for fire-fighters
Water may not effectively extinguish fire; however, it should be used to keep fire-exposed containers and surfaces cool and 
prevent explosive rupture.
SECTION 6: Accidental release measures
6.1. Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
Evacuate area.   Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. - No smoking.   Use only non-sparking tools.   
Ventilate the area with fresh air.  Refer to other sections of this SDS for information regarding physical and health hazards, 
respiratory protection, ventilation, and personal protective equipment.
6.2. Environmental precautions
Avoid release to the environment.   For larger spills, cover drains and build dikes to prevent entry into sewer systems or 
bodies of water.
6.3. Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
Contain spill.  Cover spill area with a fire-extinguishing foam.  An appropriate aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) is 
recommended.  Working from around the edges of the spill inward, cover with bentonite, vermiculite, or commercially 
available inorganic absorbent material.  Mix in sufficient absorbent until it appears dry.  Remember, adding an absorbent 
material does not remove a physical, health, or environmental hazard.  Collect as much of the spilled material as possible 
using non-sparking tools.  Place in a metal container approved for transportation by appropriate authorities.  Clean up  residue 
with an appropriate solvent selected by a qualified and authorized person.  Ventilate the area with fresh air. Read and follow 
safety precautions on the solvent label and SDS.  Seal the container.  Dispose of collected material as soon as possible.
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1. Precautions for safe handling
Do not use in a confined area with minimal air exchange.  Keep out of reach of children.   Do not handle until all safety 
precautions have been read and understood.   Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. - No smoking.   Use only 
non-sparking tools.   Take precautionary measures against static discharge.   Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray.  
Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.   Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product.   Wash thoroughly after 
handling.  Contaminated work clothing should not be allowed out of the workplace.   Avoid release to the environment.   
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.   Avoid contact with oxidizing agents (eg. chlorine, chromic acid etc.)  Wear low 
static or properly grounded shoes.  Use personal protective equipment (gloves, respirators, etc.) as required.  To minimize the 
risk of ignition, determine applicable electrical classifications for the process using this product and select specific local 
exhaust ventilation equipment to avoid flammable vapor accumulation.  Ground/bond container and receiving equipment if 
there is potential for static electricity accumulation during transfer.
7.2. Conditions for safe storage including any incompatibilities
Store in a well-ventilated place.  Keep cool.   Keep container tightly closed.   Protect from sunlight.   Store away from heat.  
Store away from acids.  Store away from oxidizing agents.

8.2. Exposure controls
8.2.1. Engineering controls
Use general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure 
Limits and/or control dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment. 
Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment.
8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Eye/face protection
Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment.  The following eye/face
protection(s) are recommended:
Indirect Vented Goggles
Skin/hand protection
Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the 
results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the 
substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. 
Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective 
clothing.  Note: Nitrile gloves may be worn over polymer laminate gloves to improve dexterity.
Gloves made from the following material(s) are recommended:  Polymer laminate
If this product is used in a manner that presents a higher potential for exposure (eg. spraying, high splash potential etc.), then 
use of protective coveralls may be necessary.  Select and use body protection to prevent contact based on the results of an 
exposure assessment.  The following protective clothing material(s) are recommended: Apron - polymer laminate
Respiratory protection
An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part of 
a full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following respirator

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.
