SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Remove person to fresh air. If signs/symptoms continue, get 
medical attention. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off with soap and plenty of water. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
Call a physician if irritation develops or persists. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water 
for at least 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Chronic effects are delayed and symptoms may not be 
observed during an exposure. 
Symptoms may differ depending on organs and systems 
affected.  These effects generally are reflected in reduced 
function or change, which may include cramping, swelling, 
respiratory issues, and general pain. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Causes skin irritation. 
Causes serious eye irritation. 
May cause drowsiness or dizziness. 
Suspected of damaging fertility or the unborn child. 
May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated
