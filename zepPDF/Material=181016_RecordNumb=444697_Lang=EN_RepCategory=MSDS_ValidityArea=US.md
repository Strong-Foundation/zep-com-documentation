Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Immediately evacuate personnel to safe areas.

hood. 
Always replace cap after use. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. 
No smoking.
