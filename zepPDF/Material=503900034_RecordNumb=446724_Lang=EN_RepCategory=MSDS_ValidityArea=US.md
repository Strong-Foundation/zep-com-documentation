4. First Aid Measures 
 
INHALATION: Remove to fresh air if effects occur and seek medical attention. 
 
SKIN CONTACT: Remove contaminated clothing. Wash all affected and exposed areas with soap and water. If skin irritation 
or redness develops or persists, seek medical attention. 
 
EYE CONTACT: Exposed eyes should be immediately flushed with copious amounts of water using a steady stream for a 
minimum of 20 minutes.  Seek immediate medical attention. 
 
INGESTION: If swallowed, get immediate medical advice by calling a Poison Control Center or hospital emergency room.  If 
advice is not available, take victim and product container to the nearest emergency treatment center or hospital. Do not attempt 
to give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
 
MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS:  Eye contact causes severe irritation with possible corneal injury. May cause skin 
irritation. Breathing high concentrations of vapors or mists may cause irritation, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, loss 
of sense of balance and visual disturbances.  Swallowing may cause gastrointestinal disturbances including irritation, 
abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, visual disturbances, decreased

urine production, malaise, unconsciousness and liver or kidney damage. Prolonged overexposure may cause damage to the 
kidneys. May cause developmental  
 
INDICATION OF IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION AND SPECIAL TREATMENT, IF NEEDED:  Seek immediate 
medical attention for eye contact, or large ingestions. 
 
NOTES TO PHYSICIAN: It is estimated that the lethal oral dose of diethylene glycol in adults is 1.0-1.2 ml/kg. Diethylene 
glycol may cause an elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis and renal tubular injury.  Liver injury may occur, but not as severe 
as kidney injury.  The signs and symptoms in diethylene glycol poisoning are those of metabolic acidosis, CNS depression and 
kidney injury.  Urinalysis may show albuminuria, hematuria and oxaluria. The current medical management of diethylene 
glycol poisoning includes elimination of diethylene glycol, correction of metabolic acidosis and prevention of kidney injury. It 
is essential to have immediate and follow-up urinalysis and clinical chemistry. There should be particular emphasis on acid-
base balance, and liver and kidney function tests. For severe and/or deteriorating cases, hemodialyis may be required.  Dialysis 
should be considered for patients who have severe metabolic acidosis, or compromise of renal function. There is no conclusive 
evidence that ethanol treatment will be beneficial. 4-Methyl pyrazole (Fomepizole®) shows some promise as treatment 
because of its apparent lack of toxicity.  Consult your poison control center. 
 
5. Firefighting Measures 
 
SUITABLE EXTINGUISHING MEDIA:  Use water spray or fog, foam, carbon dioxide or dry chemical.  Cool fire exposed 
containers with water.   
 
SPECIFIC HAZARDS ARISING FROM THE CHEMICAL:  A solid stream of water or foam directed into hot, burning liquid 
can cause frothing. Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water stream to hot liquids. 
Burning may produce carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. 
 
SPECIAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PRECAUTIONS FOR FIRE FIGHERS:  Firefighters should wear positive 
pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing for fires in areas where chemicals are used or stored. 
 
6: Accidental Release Measures 
 
PERSONAL PRECAUTIONS, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:  Wear appropriate 
protective clothing and equipment (See Section 8).   
 
METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR CONTAINMENT/CLEANUP: Collect with absorbent material and place in appropriate, 
labeled container for disposal. 
 
7. Handling and Storage 
 
PRECAUTIONS FOR SAFE HANDLING: Avoid eye contact. Avoid prolonged skin contact. Avoid breathing vapors and 
mists. Use with adequate ventilation. Wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water after use.  
 
Sudden release of hot organic chemical vapors or mists from process equipment operating at elevated temperature and 
pressure, or sudden ingress of air into vacuum equipment, may result in ignitions without any obvious ignition sources.  Spills 
of this product on hot, fibrous insulation may result in spontaneous combustion.  
 
Empty containers retain product residue and may be hazardous.  Do not cut, weld, drill, etc. containers, even empty. Do not 
reuse empty containers unless properly cleaned. 
 
 
CONDITIONS FOR SAFE STORAGE, INCLUDING ANY INCOMPATIBILITIES:  Keep away from excessive heat and 
open flames. Do not add nitrites or other nitro sating agents. Nitrosamine, which may cause cancer, may be formed.  Keep 
containers closed when not in use. Store in a cool, dry area.

APPROPRIATE ENGINEERING CONTROLS:  General ventilation should be adequate for normal use.  For operations where 
the product is heated or misted and exposures may be excessive, mechanical ventilation such as local exhaust may be needed to 
minimize exposure. 
 
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
 
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: None under normal use conditions. For operations where exposures may be excessive, a 
NIOSH approved respirator with an organic vapor cartridge and a dust/mist prefilter or supplied air respirator is recommended.  
Equipment selection depends on contaminant type and concentration.  Select in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 and good 
industrial hygiene practice.  For firefighting, use self-contained breathing apparatus. 
 
GLOVES:  Chemical resistant gloves such as PVC coated gloves are recommended to prevent prolonged/repeated skin contact. 
 
EYE PROTECTION:  Splash proof goggles are recommended to prevent eye contact. 
 
OTHER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT/CLOTHING:  Protective clothing if needed to avoid prolonged/repeated skin contact.  
Suitable washing and eye flushing facilities should be available in the work area. Contaminated clothing should be removed 
and laundered or dry cleaned before re-use.

11. Toxicological Information 
 
POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS: 
 
ACUTE HAZARDS: 
INHALATION: None expected from short term exposures at ambient temperatures. At elevated temperatures, product may 
cause respiratory irritation, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, loss of sense of balance and visual disturbances.  High 
concentrations of vapors at ambient temperatures may cause lung injury, liver dysfunction or kidney damage. 
 
SKIN CONTACT: Prolonged or repeated exposure may cause mild irritation with redness and discomfort. Prolonged contact 
may cause defatting or drying of the skin. 
 
EYE CONTACT: May cause irritation with tearing, blurred vision and possible corneal damage. 
 
INGESTION: Ingestion may cause abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, 
nausea, visual disturbances, decreased urine production, malaise, cardiopulmonary effects (metabolic acidosis), 
unconsciousness and liver or kidney damage. 
 
CHRONIC EFFECTS:  Prolonged or repeated skin contact with this product may possibly lead to irritation and dermatitis. 
Prolonged or repeated exposures may cause damage to the central nervous system, blood, lung, liver or kidneys. Adverse 
reproductive effects may also occur. Prolonged or widespread contact may result in the absorption of potentially harmful 
amounts resulting in effects similar to those listed under ingestion. Massive contact with damaged skin or with material 
sufficiently hot to burn the skin may result in absorption of potentially lethal amounts. 
 
CARCINOGENICITY LISTING:  None of the components is listed as a carcinogen or potential carcinogen by IARC, NTP, 
ACGIH, or OSHA.
