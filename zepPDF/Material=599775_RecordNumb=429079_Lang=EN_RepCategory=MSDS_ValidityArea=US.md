: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician.
