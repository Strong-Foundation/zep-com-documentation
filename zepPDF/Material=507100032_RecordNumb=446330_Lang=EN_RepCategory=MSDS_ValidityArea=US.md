6.4 Reference to other sections
Disposal should be made in accordance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. Also, see Section 13.
SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1 Precautions and safe handling
- Do not expose children and pets to this material.
- After handling product, wash thoroughly with soap and water before drinking, eating, or smoking.
- Keep away from open flames.
Soak up with inert absorbent material and dispose in accordance with local/regional/national/international regulation. 
Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal.
No recommendation given, but first aid may still be required in case of accidental exposure, inhalation or ingestion of 
this chemical. If in doubt, GET MEDICAL ATTENTION PROMPTLY!
Individuals should perform only those firefighting procedures for which they have been trained. Use water spray, dry 
chemical, alcohol foam or carbon dioxide. Use water to keep fire-exposed containers cool. If a spill or leak has not 
ignited, use water spray to disperse the vapors. Water spray may be used to flush spills away from fire and diluted 
spills to noncombustible proportions(see warning on water spray on hot liquid below.)
Fire fighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus in the positive pressure mode with a full face piece when, 
there is a possibility of exposure to smoke, fumes or hazardous decomposition products. Water spray may cause 
foaming of hot glycol so indirect application of water spray or use of other extinguishing media should be used on hot 
liquid.
For Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures, see section 8. In case of spills, beware of 
slippery floors and surfaces.
The product should not be dumped in nature but collected and delivered according to agreement with the local 
authorities.

The identified uses for this product are detailed in section 1.2.
SECTION 8 : EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
8.1 Control parameters
8.2 Exposure controls
Control Measures :
Handle in the presence of adequate ventilation. Engineering controls should
be used whenever feasible to maintain concentrations below acceptable
exposure criteria, including enclosures and local exhaust ventilation.
Respiratory Protection :
Where exposure is likely to exceed acceptable criteria
and engineering controls are not feasible, use NIOSH/MSHA approved
respiratory protection equipment. Respirators should be selected based on the
form and concentration of contaminants in air and in accordance with OSHA
(29 CFR 1910.134)
Protective Clothing :
Eye Protection :
Wear safety glasses meeting the specifications of ANSI Standard Z87.1 where
no contact with the eye is anticipated. Chemical safety goggles meeting the 
specification of ANSI Standard Z87.1 should be worn whenever there is the
possibility of splashing or other contact with the eyes.
SECTION 9: PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES
Wear gloves (e.g., nitrile, latex) and protective clothing which are impervious to the 
product for the duration of exposure if there is potential for skin contact.
