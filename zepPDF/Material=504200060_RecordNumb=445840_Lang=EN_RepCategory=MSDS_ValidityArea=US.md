○ Specific target organ toxicity (repeated exposure) : Not classified
:
oral; rat(male/female); 10 weeks; 0, 50, 250, 1000 mg/kg/day; Based on the lack
of systemic toxicity effects observed at this dose level, NOAEL=ca. 1000 mg/kg
bw/day (OECD TG 408, GLP) (read across: Alkane 4) (ECHA)
:
Not available
:
oral; rat(male/female); 0, 200, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day; 29 days; The test
compound did not cause any toxicologically significant or treatment-related
results. Therefore, the NOAEL is 1000 mg/kg/day. (OECD TG 407, GLP) (ECHA)
:
rat(male/female); dermal; 90 days; The dermal administration of Light
Catalytically Cracked Distillate at doses of 125, 500 and/or 1,250 mg/kg/day
resulted in reduction in body weight, reduction in thymus weights and an
increase in liver weight. Severe erythema and edema was also reported.
Histopathologic evaluation was limited to control animals and those dosed at
500 mg/kg/day. A NOEL was calculated as 25 mg/kg/day for males and 125
mg/kg/day for females. (OECD TG 411) (read across: Light Catalytically Cracked
Distillate) (ECHA)
Target organ: Blood, thymus, liver
:
rat; The NOAEL was reported to be >1000 mg/kg-bw/day for systemic and
reproductive toxicity in the parental generation and for developmental toxicity
in the pups. (CESAR)
:
oral; rat(male/female); 28 days; Under the experimental conditions of this study,
the test substance given to rats at the dose levels of 0, 20, 60 and 200
mg/kg/day did not induce any clinical change. The mortality in the 20
mg/kg/day group (one animal out of ten) cannot be certainly related to the
treatment. In laboratory investigations, the slight changes observed at the two
higher dose levels have no toxicological significance. At necropsy, drug-related
signs were seen in the higher dose group. The NOEL was estimated to be 60
mg/kg/day. (OECD TG 407, GLP) (ECHA)
