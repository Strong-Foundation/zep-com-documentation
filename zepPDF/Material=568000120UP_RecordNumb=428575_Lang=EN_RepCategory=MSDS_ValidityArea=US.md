SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Symptoms of poisoning may appear several hours later. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
Move to fresh air. 
Oxygen or artificial respiration if needed. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
Wash off with soap and water. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
If in eyes, rinse with water for 15 minutes. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Aspiration may cause pulmonary oedema and pneumonitis. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Chronic effects are delayed and symptoms may not be 
observed during an exposure. 
May be fatal if swallowed and enters airways. 
Causes skin irritation. 
May cause drowsiness or dizziness. 
Suspected of causing cancer. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.

SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Alcohol-resistant foam 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Dry chemical 
Water spray 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters 
: Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if 
necessary.

Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to 
local / national regulations (see section 13). 
Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal.
