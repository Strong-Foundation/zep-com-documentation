5. Fire-fighting measures
6. Accidental release measures
Mist of loaded liquid, dry chemicals, carbon dioxide, fire foam, 
and dry sand are effective.
Use of straight stream of water can cause a risk of spreading fire.
In some cases of fire, may release irritant gases.
When burnt, may generate carbon monoxide and other toxic gases.
Spray water to the surrounding facilities for cooling.
Keep unauthorized persons off the site of occurrence of fire and 
the surroundings.
Even after extinction, cool containers thoroughly with plenty of 
water.
Wear fire/flame resistant/retardant clothing.
Fight fire from windward direction while wearing protective 
equipment. If contact with skin is expected, wear impervious 
protective equipment and gloves.
Use air-breathing apparatus and protective clothing whenever 
necessary.
Suitable extinguishing media:
Unsuitable extinguishing media:
Specific hazards arising from the 
chemical:
Specific extinguishing methods:
Pay attention to the site of spillage, which is slippery.
Prevent spreading of oil spill with earth and sand, sandbags, or 
other proper materials and use care not to allow the oil spill to 
flow to  street drains, sewer systems, and rivers.
At sea, install oil spill containment booms to prevent spreading of 
spills and absorb with absorption mat or other proper materials.
In case of spillage in small quantity, collect spillage by 
absorbing with earth, sand, sawdust, waste, or other proper 
materials.
Special protective equipment and 
precautions for fire fighters:
Wear protective equipment when working.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately.
Personal precautions, protective 
equipment and emergency procedures:
Environmental precautions:
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent 
inhalation of mist.
Do not touch or walk through spillage.
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up:
In case of spillage in large quantity, enclose with embankment to 
prevent spreading of spillage and collect spillage in empty 
containers to the extent possible.

7. Handling and storage
8. Exposure controls/personal protection
Handling 
Storage
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately and make fire-
extinguishing agents available. Remove spillage completely, and 
ventilate and clean the site and the surroundings.  
Prevention of second accident:
Keep away from any possible contact with sparks, open flames, and 
high-temperature materials, and do not allow release of vapor 
without justification.
Use pumps or other proper equipment for taking out from containers. 
Do not siphon with your mouth using a tube. Do not drink.
Technical measures:
In case of spillage, immediately inform the organizations concerned 
of the spillage to prevent possible accidents and spreading of 
spillage.
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent 
inhalation of mist.
In case of vapor/mist dispersion, install a closed system, local 
ventilation system, and/or other proper equipment for the sources 
of vapor/mist generation.
Avoid rough handling of containers such as falling, dropping, 
exposing to shock, and dragging.
Maintain adequate ventilation when handling indoors.
Wash hands and face thoroughly after handling.
Be careful with fire.
Avoid falling, dropping, exposing to shock, or dragging of 
containers.
Wear protective gloves when opening containers to eliminate a risk 
of hand injury.
Store in a well ventilated, cool, dry, dark place, protecting from 
direct sunlight and keeping away from any potential ignition 
sources and high-temperature materials.
Store tightly stopped after use to prevent possible contamination 
with dust and moisture.
Preferably store locked up in a proper storage area.
Use spill-proof containers that are free of damage/corrosion.
