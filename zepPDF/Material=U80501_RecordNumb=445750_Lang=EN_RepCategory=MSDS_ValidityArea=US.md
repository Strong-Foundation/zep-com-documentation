SECTION 4
FIRST AID MEASURES
INHALATION
Remove from further exposure.  For those providing assistance, avoid exposure to yourself or others.  Use 
adequate respiratory protection.  If respiratory irritation, dizziness, nausea, or unconsciousness occurs, seek 
immediate medical assistance.  If breathing has stopped, assist ventilation with a mechanical device or use 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
SKIN CONTACT
Wash contact areas with soap and water.  
EYE CONTACT
Flush thoroughly with water.  If irritation occurs, get medical assistance.
INGESTION
First aid is normally not required. Seek medical attention if discomfort occurs.
SECTION 5
FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA
Appropriate Extinguishing Media:  Use water fog, foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide (CO2) to 
extinguish flames.
Inappropriate Extinguishing Media:  Straight Streams of Water 
FIRE FIGHTING
Fire Fighting Instructions:  Evacuate area.  Prevent runoff from fire control or dilution from entering 
streams, sewers, or drinking water supply.  Firefighters should use standard protective equipment and in 
enclosed spaces, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  Use water spray to cool fire exposed surfaces 
and to protect personnel. 
Unusual Fire Hazards:  Water used on hot oil can cause explosions from steam generation. Oil saturated 
hot lagging will result in reduced auto ignition temperature.
Hazardous Combustion Products:   Smoke, Fume, Incomplete combustion products, Oxides of carbon

 SECTION 6
ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES
In the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable 
regulations. US regulations require reporting releases of this material to the environment which exceed the 
applicable reportable quantity or oil spills which could reach any waterway including intermittent dry creeks. 
The National Response Center can be reached at (800)424-8802.
PROTECTIVE MEASURES
Avoid contact with spilled material.  See Section 5 for fire fighting information.  See the Hazard Identification 
Section for Significant Hazards.  See Section 4 for First Aid Advice.  See Section 8 for advice on the 
minimum requirements for personal protective equipment. Additional protective measures may be 
necessary, depending on the specific circumstances and/or the expert judgment of the emergency
responders.  
 
SPILL MANAGEMENT
Land Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Recover by pumping or with suitable absorbent.
Water Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Confine the spill immediately with booms.  Warn other 
shipping.  Remove from the surface by skimming or with suitable absorbents.  Seek the advice of a specialist 
before using dispersants.
Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this material; 
however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) wave and current 
direction and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.  For this reason, local experts 
should be consulted.  Note:  Local regulations may prescribe or limit action to be taken. 
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS
Large Spills:  Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal.  Prevent entry into waterways, 
sewers, basements or confined areas.
 SECTION 7
HANDLING AND STORAGE
HANDLING
Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard.   
Static Accumulator:   This material is NOT a static accumulator.
STORAGE
Do not store in open or unlabeled containers.

 SECTION 8
EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
 Exposure limits/standards for materials that can be formed when handling this product:   When mists / 
aerosols can occur, the following are recommended:  
5 mg/m³ - ACGIH TLV
10 mg/m³ - ACGIH STEL
5 mg/m³ - OSHA PEL 
NOTE: Limits/standards shown for guidance only.  Follow applicable regulations.
ENGINEERING CONTROLS
The level of protection and types of controls necessary will vary depending upon potential exposure 
conditions.  Control measures to consider:
 No special requirements under ordinary conditions of use and with adequate ventilation. 
PERSONAL PROTECTION
 
Personal protective equipment selections vary based on potential exposure conditions such as applications, 
handling practices, concentration and ventilation.  Information on the selection of protective equipment for 
use with this material, as provided below, is based upon intended, normal usage.  
Respiratory Protection:   No special requirements under ordinary conditions of use and with adequate 
ventilation. 
For high airborne concentrations, use an approved supplied-air respirator, operated in positive pressure 
mode.  Supplied air respirators with an escape bottle may be appropriate when oxygen levels are 
inadequate, gas/vapor warning properties are poor, or if air purifying filter capacity/rating may be exceeded.
Hand Protection:  No protection is ordinarily required under normal conditions of use.
Eye Protection:   If contact is likely, safety glasses with side shields are recommended.
Skin and Body Protection:    No skin protection is ordinarily required under normal conditions of use.  In 
accordance with good industrial hygiene practices, precautions should be taken to avoid skin contact.
Specific Hygiene Measures:   Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing after 
handling the material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking.  Routinely wash work clothing and 
protective equipment to remove contaminants.  Discard contaminated clothing and footwear that cannot be 
cleaned. Practice good housekeeping.

In locations and/or applications where local legislation does not specify maximum concentration limits, Hydrotex 
Partners Ltd. recommends that the same 10 ppm limit be observed, as up to this concentration, ULTRA-KLEEN 
products will not impart undesirable taste, odor or color to food, nor will cause severe health effects.
To be consistent with good manufacturing practice, the amount used should be the minimum required to accomplish 
the desired technical effect on the equipment, and appropriate corrective action should be taken should excessive 
incidental contact with food be detected.
