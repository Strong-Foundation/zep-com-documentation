firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Silicon oxides 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments.

regulations. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. 
No smoking. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards.
