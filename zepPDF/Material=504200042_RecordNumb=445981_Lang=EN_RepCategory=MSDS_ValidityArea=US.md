6. Accidental release measures
7. Handling and storage
Keep away from any possible contact with sparks, open flames, 
and high-temperature materials, and do not allow release of 
vapor without justification.
Handling 
Keep unauthorized persons off the site of occurrence of fire and 
the surroundings.
Even after extinction, cool containers thoroughly with plenty of 
water.
Wear fire/flame resistant/retardant clothing.
Fight fire from windward direction while wearing protective 
equipment. If contact with skin is expected, wear impervious 
protective equipment and gloves.
Use air-breathing apparatus and protective clothing whenever 
necessary.
Special protective equipment and 
precautions for fire fighters:
Wear protective equipment when working.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately.
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent 
inhalation of mist.
Do not touch or walk through spillage.
Pay attention to the site of spillage, which is slippery.
Prevent spreading of oil spill with earth and sand, sandbags, or 
other proper materials and use care not to allow the oil spill 
to flow to  street drains, sewer systems, and rivers.
At sea, install oil spill containment booms to prevent spreading 
of spills and absorb with absorption mat or other proper 
materials.
In case of spillage in small quantity, collect spillage by 
absorbing with earth, sand, sawdust, waste, or other proper 
materials.
In case of spillage in large quantity, enclose with embankment 
to prevent spreading of spillage and collect spillage in empty 
containers to the extent possible.
In case of spillage, immediately inform the organizations 
concerned of the spillage to prevent possible accidents and 
spreading of spillage.
Remove nearby potential ignition sources immediately and make 
fire-extinguishing agents available. Remove spillage completely, 
and ventilate and clean the site and the surroundings.

ventilation system, and/or other proper equipment for the 
sources of vapor/mist generation.
When mist is generated, use respiratory equipment to prevent 
inhalation of mist.
Use pumps or other proper equipment for taking out from 
containers. Do not siphon with your mouth using a tube. Do not 
drink.
