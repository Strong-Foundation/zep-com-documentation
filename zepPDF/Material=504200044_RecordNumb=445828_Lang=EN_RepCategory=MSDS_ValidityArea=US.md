If breathing difficulty persists: Get medical advice/attention.
Skin Contact: If on skin: Wash with plenty of soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing and wash before
reuse. If skin irritation persists: Get medical advice/attention.
Eye Contact:  If in eyes: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present
and easy to do. Continue rinsing. If eye irritation persists: Get medical advice/attention.
Ingestion:    If swallowed: Immediately call a poison center/doctor. Do NOT induce vomiting unless directed to

MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS AND EFFECTS, BOTH ACUTE AND DELAYED:
See Section 11: Toxicological Information and effects.
INDICATION OF ANY IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION AND SPECIAL TREATMENT REQUIRED:
Treat symptomatically.               
SECTION 5 - FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES
Suitable Extinguishing Media: CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), dry chemical, or water fog.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Water spray may be unsuitable. However if water is used fog nozzles are preferred. Water
may be used to cool closed containers to prevent pressure build-up and possible explosion when exposed to extreme heat.
Specific Hazards Arising From the Chemical: Closed containers exposed to heat from fire may build pressure and
explode. Products of combustion may include but are not limited to: oxides of carbon.
Special Protective Equipment and Precautions for Fire-Fighters: Full protective equipment including
self-contained breathing apparatus should be used.

Personal Precautions: Use personal protection recommended in Section 8.
Environmental Precautions: Prevent contamination of soil/ground, waterways, drains, and sewers.
Methods of Containment: Absorb spilled liquid in suitable material.
Methods for Clean-Up: Use spark-proof tools to sweep or scrape up, containerize, and dispose of properly.
Other Information: Ensure adequate ventilation.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
Precautions for Safe Handling: 
Vapors may ignite explosively. Prevent buildup of vapors. Keep from sparks, heat, flame or other heat sources.
Do not smoke. Turn off pilot lights, heaters, electric motors and other sources of ignition during use and
until all vapors are gone. Do not puncture or incinerate/burn container. Keep container tightly closed while not in use.
Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities:
Store in dry, well-ventilated area and in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. Do not expose to heat
or store at temperatures above 50 degrees C / 122 degrees F. If storing in cold temperatures, allow product to warm to
room temperature before use. Keep container tightly closed and away from heat and sunlight when not in use.
