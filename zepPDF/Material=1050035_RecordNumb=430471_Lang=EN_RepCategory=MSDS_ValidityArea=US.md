Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: No smoking. 
Observe label precautions. 
Keep in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects.
