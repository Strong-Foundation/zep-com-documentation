SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
Get medical attention immediately. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
Move to fresh air. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Symptoms of poisoning may not appear for several hours. 
Keep under medical supervision for at least 48 hours. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Harmful if swallowed or in contact with skin.
