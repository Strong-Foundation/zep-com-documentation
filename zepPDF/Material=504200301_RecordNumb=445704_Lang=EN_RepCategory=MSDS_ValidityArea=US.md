toxicity, and the 364-day cohort result is a high-capacity al-citrate group of babies. Obstructed clear 
and consistent effects on body weight after reason in the , Na-citrate effects observed in female 
offspring, urinary lesions were observed in high doses, urinary tract lesions more frequently observed 
in males, no evidence of effects on memory, learning, critical effects, and front and back leg grip 
strength observed in 100 mg Al/kg bw/day group, urinary tract, and urinary tracte Because effects 
were observed in both high-capacity and NA-citrate groups, Al-based LOAEL / NOAEL cannot be 
proposed based on the results of sexual maturity in this study, the weight difference at the end of the 
reason relative to the control group is high
Although it occurs in the Al-citrate group of capacity and is considered to be related to administration, 
the role of Al is unclear, relative differences between the high-capacity Al-citrate group and Na-citrate 
group may be related to differences in liquid consumption

Aluminum hydroxide
Oral: There were no clinical signs of associated addiction after treatment or during the 14-day 
observation period. Soft feces appear in all individuals on the day of administration only. No similar 
clinical signs after the first day of the observation period / no pathological treatment effects (rat / 
female / OECD TG 423 / GLP) Inhalation: The observed clinical symptoms were consistent with 
breathing difficulties. Survivors were described as showing "somewhat" toxic effects and good recovery 
until the end of the 14-day observation period. More discoloration was observed on the lung surface of 
treated animals compared to control animals. A "slight" increase in the number of lung lesions in test 
animals was also reported, but no individual data or additional details were provided. The dead animals 
were found to have white gel in their organs and stomachs. (Rats / Male / Equivalent or similar to 
Guideline: OECD TG 403).

Oral (chronic): As a result of oral exposure through rats, LOAEL for aluminium toxicity is designated 
as 1075 mg AlCitrate/kg bw/day (100 mg Al/kg bw/day) (fatal effects, fairly consistent results for front 
and back leg grip strength), Rat, OECD TG 426 and OECD TG 45LP2, GLP2.
