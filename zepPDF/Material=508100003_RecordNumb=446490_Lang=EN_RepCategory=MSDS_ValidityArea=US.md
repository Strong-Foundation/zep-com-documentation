Description of first aid measures 
Page 2 of 17 
 
 
 
Part #:  1060099-00-A 
Issue Date: 02/25/2015 
General advice: First Aid responders should pay attention to self-protection and use the 
recommended protective clothing (chemical resistant gloves, splash protection).  If potential for 
exposure exists refer to Section 8 for specific personal protective equipment. 
Inhalation: Move person to fresh air; if effects occur, consult a physician. 
Skin contact: Remove material from skin immediately by washing with soap and plenty of water. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes while washing. Seek medical attention if irritation persists. 
Wash clothing before reuse.  Discard items which cannot be decontaminated, including leather articles 
such as shoes, belts and watchbands. 
Eye contact: Flush eyes thoroughly with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses after t he 
initial 1-2 minutes and continue flushing for several additional minutes.  If effects occur, consult a 
physician, preferably an ophthalmologist. 
Ingestion: If swallowed, seek medical attention.  Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by 
medical personnel. 
Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed: Aside from the information found 
under Description of first aid measures (above) and Indication of immediate medical attention and 
special treatment needed (below), any additional important symptoms and effects are described in 
Section 11: Toxicology Information. 
Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed 
Notes to physician: No specific antidote.  Treatment of exposure should be directed at the control of 
symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient. 
5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
Suitable extinguishing media: Water fog or fine spray. Dry chemical fire extinguishers. Carbon 
dioxide fire extinguishers. Foam. Alcohol resistant foams (ATC type) are preferred. General purpose 
synthetic foams (including AFFF) or protein foams may function, but will be less effective. 
Unsuitable extinguishing media: Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire. 
Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture 
Hazardous combustion products: During a fire, smoke may contain the original material in addition 
to combustion products of varying composition which may be toxic and/or irritating.  Combustion 
products may include and are not limited to:  Carbon monoxide.  Carbon dioxide.  Combustion 
products may include trace amounts of:  Nitrogen oxides. 
Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards:   Container may rupture from gas generation in a fire 
situation. Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water stream to 
hot liquids. 
Advice for firefighters 
Fire Fighting Procedures: Keep people away.  Isolate fire and deny unnecessary entry.  Use water 
spray to cool fire exposed containers and fire affected zone until fire is out and danger of reignition has 
passed. Fight fire from protected location or safe distance. Consider the use of unmanned hose 
holders or monitor nozzles. Immediately withdraw all personnel from the area in case of rising sound 
from venting safety device or discoloration of the container. Burning liquids may be extinguished by 
dilution with water.  Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire. Move container from fire area if 
Page 3 of 17 
 
 
Part #:  1060099-00-A 
Issue Date: 02/25/2015 
this is possible without hazard.  Burning liquids may be moved by flushing with water to protect 
personnel and minimize property damage. 
Special protective equipment for firefighters: Wear positive-pressure self-contained breathing 
apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, coat, trousers, 
boots, and gloves).  Avoid contact with this material during fire fighting operations. If contact is likely, 
change to full chemical resistant fire fighting clothing with self-contained breathing apparatus. If this is 
not available, wear full chemical resistant clothing with self-contained breathing apparatus and fight 
fire from a remote location.  If protective equipment is not available or not used, fight fire from a 
protected location or safe distance. 
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emerge ncy procedures: Use appropriate safety 
equipment. For additional information, refer to Section 8, Exposure Controls and Personal Protection. 
Environmental precautions: Prevent from entering into soil, ditches, sewers, waterways and/or 
groundwater. See Section 12, Ecological Information. 
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up: Small spills: Absorb with materials such 
as: Sand. Vermiculite. Collect in suitable and properly labeled containers.  Large spills: Contain 
spilled material if possible.  Pump into suitable and properly labeled containers.  See Section 13, 
Disposal Considerations,  for additional information. 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
Precautions for safe handling: Avoid prolonged or repeated contact with skin. Wash thoroughly 
after handling. Spills of these organic materials on hot fibrous insulations may lead to lowering of the 
autoignition temperatures possibly resulting in spontaneous combustion. See Section 8, EXPOSURE 
CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION. 
Spills of these organic materials on hot fibrous insulations may lead to lowering of the autoignition 
temperatures possibly resulting in spontaneous combustion. 
Conditions for safe storage: Store in the following material(s): Carbon steel. Stainless steel. 
Phenolic lined steel drums.  Do not store in: Aluminum.  Copper.  Galvanized iron. Galvanized steel.

Exposure controls 
Engineering controls: Use local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to maintain 
airborne levels below exposure limit requirements or guidelines.  If there are no applicable exposure 
limit requirements or guidelines, general ventilation should be sufficient for most operations. 
Individual protection measures 
Eye/face protection: Use safety glasses (with side shields). 
Skin protection 
Hand protection: Use gloves chemically resistant to this material when prolonged or 
frequently repeated contact could occur.  Examples of preferred glove barrier 
materials include: Butyl rubber. Ethyl vinyl alcohol laminate (“EVAL”). Examples of 
acceptable glove barrier materials include:  Natural rubber (“latex”). Neoprene. 
Nitrile/butadiene rubber (“nitrile” or “NBR”).  Polyvinyl chloride (“PVC” or “vinyl”). 
NOTICE: The selection of a specific glove for a particular application and duration of 
use in a workplace should also take into account all relevant workplace factors such 
as, but not limited to: Other chemicals which may be handled, physical requirements 
(cut/puncture protection, dexterity, thermal protection), potential body reactions to 
glove materials, as well as the instructions/specifications provided by the glove 
supplier. 
Other protection: Wear clean, body-covering clothing. 
Respiratory protection: Respiratory protection should be worn when there is a potential to 
exceed the exposure limit requirements or guidelines. If there are no applicable exposure limit 
requirements or guidelines, wear respiratory protection when adverse effects, such as 
respiratory irritation or discomfort have been experienced, or where indicated by your risk 
assessment process.  For most conditions no respiratory protection should be needed; 
however, if discomfort is experienced, use an approved air-purifying respirator. 
The following should be effective types of air-purifying respirators:  Organic vapor cartridge.
