4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Inhalation: 
Move to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If not breathing, give 
artificial respiration. If symptoms develop and persist, get medical attention.  
 
Skin contact: 
Do not pull bonded skin apart.  Soak in warm soapy water. Gently peel apart 
using a blunt instrument.  If skin is burned due to the rapid generation of heat 
by a large drop, seek medical attention. If lips are bonded, apply warm water 
to the lips and encourage wetting and pressure from saliva in mouth. Peel or 
roll lips apart. Do not pull lips apart with direct opposing force.  
 
Eye contact: 
Immediately flush with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Get medical 
attention.  If eyelids are bonded closed, release eyelashes with warm water by 
covering with a wet pad.  Do not force eye open.  Cyanoacrylate will bond to 
eye protein and will cause a lachrymatory effect which will help to debond the 
adhesive.  Keep eye covered until debonding is complete, usually within 1-3 
days.  Medical attention should be sought in case solid particles of 
polymerized cyanoacrylate trapped behind the eyelid caused abrasive 
damage.  
 
Ingestion: 
Ensure breathing passages are not obstructed. The product will polymerize 
rapidly and bond to the mouth making it almost impossible to swallow. Saliva 
will separate any solidified product in several hours. Prevent the patient from 
swallowing any separated mass. 
  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
Notes to physician: 
Surgery is not necessary to separate accidentally bonded tissues. Experience 
has shown that bonded tissues are best treated by passive, non-surgical first 
aid.  If rapid curing has caused thermal burns they should be treated 
symptomatically after adhesive is removed. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media: 
Water spray (fog), foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.   
 
Special firefighting procedures: 
Wear a self-contained breathing apparatus with a full face piece operated in 
pressure-demand or other positive pressure mode.  
 
Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
None

Hazardous combustion products: 
Trace amounts of toxic and/or irritating fumes may be released and the use of 
breathing apparatus is recommended. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected 
personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Ventilate area. Do not allow product to enter sewer or waterways.  
 
Clean-up methods: 
Do not use cloths for mopping up. Flood with water to complete polymerization 
and scrape off the floor. Cured material can be disposed of as non-hazardous 
waste. Refer to Section 8 "Exposure Controls / Personal Protection" prior to 
clean up.  
 
7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling: 
Prevent contact with eyes, skin and clothing.  Do not breathe vapor and mist.  
Wash thoroughly after handling. Avoid contact with fabric or paper goods. 
Contact with these materials may cause rapid polymerization which can 
generate smoke and strong irritating vapors, and cause thermal burns.  
 
Storage: 
Keep in a cool, well ventilated area away from heat, sparks and open flame. 
Keep container tightly closed until ready for use.  
 
8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
 
Employers should complete an assessment of all workplaces to determine the need for, and selection of, proper exposure 
controls and protective equipment for each task performed.

Engineering controls: 
Use positive down-draft exhaust ventilation if general ventilation is insufficient 
to maintain vapor concentration below established exposure limits.  
 
Respiratory protection: 
Use NIOSH approved respirator if there is potential to exceed exposure 
limit(s).  
 
Eye/face protection: 
Safety goggles or safety glasses with side shields. Full face protection should 
be used if the potential for splashing or spraying of product exists.  
 
Skin protection: 
Use nitrile gloves and aprons as necessary to prevent contact.  Do not use 
PVC,  nylon or cotton.

11.  TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION 
 
Relevant routes of exposure: 
Skin, Inhalation, Eyes 
 
 
Potential Health Effects/Symptoms 
 
Inhalation: 
May cause respiratory tract irritation. Exposure to vapors above the established exposure limit 
results in respiratory irritation, which may lead to difficulty in breathing and tightness in the 
chest. 
Skin contact: 
Bonds skin in seconds. May cause skin irritation. Cyanoacrylates have been reported to cause 
allergic reaction but due to rapid polymerization at the skin surface, an allergic response is rare. 
Cyanoacrylates generate heat on solidification. In rare circumstances a large drop will burn the 
skin. Cured adhesive does not present a health hazard even if bonded to the skin. 
Eye contact: 
Irritating to eyes. Causes excessive tearing. Eyelids may bond.  
Ingestion: 
Not expected to be harmful by ingestion. Rapidly polymerizes (solidifies) and bonds in mouth. It 
is almost impossible to swallow.
