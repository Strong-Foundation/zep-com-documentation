· Personal protective equipment:
· General protective and hygienic measures:
Keep away from foodstuffs, beverages and feed.
Immediately remove all soiled and contaminated clothing.
Wash hands before breaks and at the end of work.
Store protective clothing separately.
Avoid contact with the eyes and skin.
· Breathing equipment:
In case of brief exposure or low pollution use respiratory filter device. In case of intensive or longer exposure use
respiratory protective device that is independent of circulating air.
· Protection of hands:
Due to missing tests no recommendation to the glove material can be given for the product/ the preparation/ the
chemical mixture.
Selection of the glove material on consideration of the penetration times, rates of diffusion and the degradation
Protective gloves
The glove material has to be impermeable and resistant to the product/ the substance/ the preparation.

· Material of gloves
The selection of the suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality and
varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. As the product is a preparation of several substances, the resistance
of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the application.
