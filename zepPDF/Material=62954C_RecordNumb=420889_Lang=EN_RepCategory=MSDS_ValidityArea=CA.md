SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes.

Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Symptoms may include shortness of breath, dry cough, and 
irritation of the nose, eyes, lips, mouth, and throat. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Toxic if swallowed, in contact with skin or if inhaled. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.

Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to 
local / national regulations (see section 13). 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Open drum carefully as content may be under pressure. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: No smoking.
