General information
5. Fire-fighting measures
Alcohol resistant foam. Water fog. Carbon dioxide (CO2). Dry chemical powder, carbon dioxide,
sand or earth may be used for small fires only.
Suitable extinguishing media
Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire.
Unsuitable extinguishing
media
Contents under pressure. Pressurized container may rupture when exposed to heat or flame. This
product is a poor conductor of electricity and can become electrostatically charged. If sufficient
charge is accumulated, ignition of flammable mixtures can occur. Static electricity accumulation
may be significantly increased by the presence of small quantities of water or other contaminants.
Material will float and may ignite on surface of water. During fire, gases hazardous to health may
be formed.
Specific hazards arising from
the chemical
Firefighters must use standard protective equipment including flame retardant coat, helmet with
face shield, gloves, rubber boots, and in enclosed spaces, SCBA.

exposed to heat or flame.
General fire hazards
6. Accidental release measures
Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Keep out of
low areas. Remove all possible sources of ignition in the surrounding area. Many vapors are
heavier than air and will spread along ground and collect in low or confined areas (sewers,
basements, tanks). Wear appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Avoid
breathing mist or vapor. Emergency personnel need self-contained breathing equipment. Do not
touch damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing.
Ventilate closed spaces before entering them. Use appropriate containment to avoid
environmental contamination. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot be
contained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.
Personal precautions,
protective equipment and
emergency procedures
Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Keep
combustibles (wood, paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material. This material is classified as a
water pollutant under the Clean Water Act and should be prevented from contaminating soil or
from entering sewage and drainage systems which lead to waterways. Stop the flow of material, if
this is without risk. Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly
to remove residual contamination. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.
Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up
Avoid release to the environment. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid
discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground. Inform appropriate managerial or
supervisory personnel of all environmental releases. Use appropriate containment to avoid
environmental contamination.
Environmental precautions
7. Handling and storage
Minimize fire risks from flammable and combustible materials (including combustible dust and
static accumulating liquids) or dangerous reactions with incompatible materials. Pressurized
container:  Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Do not use if spray button is missing or defective.
Do not spray on a naked flame or any other incandescent material. Do not smoke while using or
until sprayed surface is thoroughly dry. Do not cut, weld, solder, drill, grind, or expose containers to
heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. Use caution around energized equipment. The
metal container will conduct electricity if it contacts a live source. This may result in injury to the
user from electrical shock and/or flash fire. Avoid breathing mist or vapor. Avoid contact with eyes,
skin, and clothing. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Wear appropriate personal protective
equipment. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Observe good industrial hygiene practices.
Avoid release to the environment. For product usage instructions, please see the product label.
Precautions for safe handling
Level 3 Aerosol.
Pressurized container. Protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures exceeding
50°C/122 °F. Do not puncture, incinerate or crush. Do not handle or store near an open flame,
heat or other sources of ignition. This material can accumulate static charge which may cause
spark and become an ignition source. Avoid spark promoters. These alone may be insufficient to
remove static electricity. Store in a well-ventilated place. Store away from incompatible materials
(see Section 10 of the SDS).
