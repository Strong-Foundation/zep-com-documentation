SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Symptoms of poisoning may appear several hours later. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Call a physician or poison control centre immediately. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Do NOT induce vomiting. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, coughing, 
wheezing, throat irritation, and tightness/closure of airway. 
 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
May cause an allergic skin reaction. 
Toxic if inhaled. 
Harmful if swallowed. 
May cause allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing 
difficulties if inhaled.
