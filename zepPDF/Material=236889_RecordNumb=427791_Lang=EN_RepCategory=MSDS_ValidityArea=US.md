SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice.

wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses.
