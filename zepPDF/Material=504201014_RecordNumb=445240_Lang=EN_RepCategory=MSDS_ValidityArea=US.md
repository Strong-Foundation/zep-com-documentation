SECTION 9: PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES
Respiratory: Level of exposure needs to be determined.  If required, use a 
particulate filter, a NIOSH-approved air purifying respirator with organic vapor 
cartridge or a supplied air respirator.
Contain and absorb with inert material. (e.g. oil dry, sand)
Dispose in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations.
In the event of a large spill, contain material and  recover for use if possible. 
Avoid discharge into drains, water courses and the ground.
SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE
Keep away from ignition sources.  Keep containers tightly closed.  Store in a 
cool, dry and well ventilated area.  
Avoid prolonged or repeated skin contact and avoid breathing vapors. 
Avoid exposure to oxidizing agents.  
SECTION 8: EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
Use with adequate ventilation.  
Eye/Face: Face shield, goggles
Skin: Chemical protective gloves.
Remove all sources of ignition.  Provide adequate ventilation.
SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES
Carbon dioxide (CO2), foam, water fog or dry chemical.  
Do not use stream/jet of water as this will spread fire.
Vaporized material may form explosive mixture with air.  Thermal 
decomposition (burning) will produce oxides of carbon including carbon 
monoxide and may also produce irritating, corrosive and/or toxic gases, vapors 
and fumes.
Self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective gear must be worn in 
case of fire.
