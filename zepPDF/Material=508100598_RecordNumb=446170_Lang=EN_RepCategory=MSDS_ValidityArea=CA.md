Skin contact: 
Wipe off paste with paper towel or cloth. Wash with soap and water. If skin 
irritation persists, call a physician.  
 
Eye contact: 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. Get medical attention.

Do not induce vomiting. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious 
person. Get medical attention.  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media:

turn-out gear. Prevent inhalation of fumes and gases.  
 
Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
None  
 
Hazardous combustion products: 
Oxides of carbon. Oxides of silicon. Formaldehyde. Irritating organic vapours. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected 
personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Do not allow product to enter sewer or waterways.  
 
Clean-up methods:

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling: 
Prevent contact with eyes, skin and clothing.  Do not breathe vapor and mist.  
Wash thoroughly after handling. Do not handle contact lenses until all sealant 
has been removed from hands. Residual sealant may transfer to lenses and 
cause eye irritation.  
 
Storage: 
Store in a dry area below 90° F. Keep container closed.  
 
For information on product shelf life contact Henkel Customer Service at (800) 243-4874. 
 
8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
 
Employers should complete an assessment of all workplaces to determine the need for, and selection of, proper exposure 
controls and protective equipment for each task performed.

Potential Health Effects/Symptoms 
 
Inhalation: 
Inhalation of vapors or mists of the product may be irritating to the respiratory system. When 
heated to temperatures exceeding 300° F (150° C) in the presence of air, silicones may form 
formaldehyde vapors. Formaldehyde is a potential cancer hazard and a known skin and 
respiratory sensitizer.  Vapors irritate the eyes, nose and throat. Safe handling conditions may 
be maintained by keeping formaldehyde vapor concentrations below the OSHA permissible 
limit. The silane is a skin and eye irritant and prolonged contact may cause eye and skin burns. 
The low concentration makes such overexposure unlikely and minimizes its affect on health 
and safety. 
Skin contact: 
Causes skin irritation. May cause allergic skin reaction. 
Eye contact: 
Causes serious eye irritation.  
Ingestion: 
Not expected under normal conditions of use. May be harmful if swallowed.
