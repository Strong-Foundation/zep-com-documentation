SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Symptoms of poisoning may appear several hours later. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: Wash off with soap and water. 
If on skin, rinse well with water. 
If on clothes, remove clothes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Do NOT induce vomiting. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Chronic effects are delayed and symptoms may not be 
observed during an exposure. 
Symptoms may differ depending on organs and systems 
affected.  These effects generally are reflected in reduced 
function or change, which may include cramping, swelling, 
respiratory issues, and general pain. 
Aspiration may cause pulmonary oedema and pneumonitis. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Causes skin irritation. 
May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated 
exposure if swallowed.
