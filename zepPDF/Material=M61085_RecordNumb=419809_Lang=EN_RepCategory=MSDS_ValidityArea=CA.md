SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Consult a physician. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Symptoms of poisoning may appear several hours later. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
Move to fresh air. 
Oxygen or artificial respiration if needed. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water 
for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing 
and shoes.  Get immediate medical attention while applying 
and massaging in 2.5% calcium gluconate gel.  Wash clothing 
before reuse.  Clean shoes thoroughly before reuse.  Get 
immediate medical attention. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, 
for at least 15 minutes. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness.

Fatal in contact with skin. 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
Delayed treatment may result in hypoglycemia, begin 
treatment with topical application calcium gluconate, and 
monitor blood chemistry. 
 
Contact a poison treatment specialist immediately if large 
quantities have been ingested or inhaled, or contact with large 
portions of the body have occurred.

Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Technical measures 
: Due to the unique hazards associated with hydrogen fluoride 
(HF), it is highly recommended that emergency pre-planning 
and training of employees occur to mitigate and facilitate rapid 
response to an exposure. Facilities need to have access to 
emergency showers, proper personal protective equipment 
(PPE), a supply of calcium gluconate gel, and complete 
training of all individuals on proper PPE and procedures. 
 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Do not breathe vapours/dust. 
Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
To avoid spills during handling keep bottle on a metal tray. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated 
place. 
Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and 
kept upright to prevent leakage. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Oxidizing agents 
Store and keep away from bases and alkalies.
