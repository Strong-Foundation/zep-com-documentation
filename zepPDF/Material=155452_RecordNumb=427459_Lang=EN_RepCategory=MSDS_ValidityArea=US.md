Do not leave the victim unattended. 
 
If inhaled 
: If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Move to fresh air. 
 
In case of skin contact

Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
Immediately flush eyes for at least 15 minutes. Get medical 
attention. 
 
If swallowed 
: Rinse mouth. 
Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Symptoms may include central nervous system depression, 
resulting in headache, nausea and/or dizziness. 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Harmful if swallowed. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards.
