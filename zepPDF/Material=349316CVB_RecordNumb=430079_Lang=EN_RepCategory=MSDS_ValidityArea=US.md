Smoke 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers. 
 
Special protective equipment 
for firefighters

Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for

For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Open drum carefully as content may be under pressure. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Persons susceptible to skin sensitisation problems or asthma, 
allergies, chronic or recurrent respiratory disease should not 
be employed in any process in which this mixture is being 
used. 
Always replace cap after use. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: BEWARE: Aerosol is pressurized. Keep away from direct sun 
exposure and temperatures over 50 °C. Do not open by force 
or throw into fire even after use. Do not spray on flames or 
red-hot objects. 
No smoking. 
Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated 
place. 
Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and 
kept upright to prevent leakage. 
Observe label precautions. 
Electrical installations / working materials must comply with 
the technological safety standards. 
 
Materials to avoid 
: Store and keep away from, reducing agents, bases and 
alkalies. 
Do not store near acids.
