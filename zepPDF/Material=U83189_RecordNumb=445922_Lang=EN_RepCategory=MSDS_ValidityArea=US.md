SECTION 4: FIRST-AID MEASURES 
 
The following procedures are recommended as emergency first aid only.  They are not intended to replace 
or supplant the treatment advice of a physician or other authorized health care specialist. 
  
Inhalation:  Move person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance, and then give 
artificial respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth if possible.  Call a poison control center or doctor for 
further treatment advice.  
 
Skin Contact:  Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 
minutes.  Call a poison control center or doctor for further treatment advice. 
 
Eye Contact:  Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes.  Remove contact 
lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes, then continue rinsing eye. Call a poison control center or doctor 
for further treatment advice.   
 
If Swallowed:   Call a poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice.  Have person sip 
a glass of water if able to swallow.  Do not induce vomiting unless told to do so by a poison control center 
of doctor.  Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
 
Chlorine dioxide vapors are emitted when this product contacts acids or chlorine.  If these vapors are 
inhaled move person into fresh air.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration.  Consult a physician.  
Monitor patient closely for delayed development of pulmonary edema which may occur up to 48-72 hours 
post inhalation. 
 
SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Substance does not burn but supports the combustion of flammable substances through the liberation of 
oxygen.  Water is the preferred extinguishing media when it is compatible with the burning substance.   If 
water is not compatible, use dry powder extinguisher.  
 
Burning will release hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) and oxides of sodium (NaOx ). 
 
Firefighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) if necessary.   
 
SECTION 6:  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
SPILL CONTAINMENT: 
 
- 3 -
 
Avoid allowing spilled material to dry to crystalline sodium chlorite.  Dry sodium chlorite is a strong 
oxidizer and creates a potential fire hazard when in contact with combustible materials.  Use a non-
combustible absorbent such as sand or vermiculite to absorb spilled or leaked Purogene before it dries.  
Remove any powder residue from dried Purogene by rinsing with water.  Absorb rinse water with sand or 
other non-combustible absorbent and discard.  Do not discharge this product to storm drains or to any 
surface or groundwater source unless specifically allowed under a valid NPDES permit.  
 
SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
HANDLING: 
 
Use product only as directed by the label.  Avoid contact with skin and eyes; avoid breathing any vapors 
or fumes resulting from product activation. Wash thoroughly after handling.  Thoroughly rinse all 
protective gear and handling equipment, such as transfer pumps and lines, with water prior to reuse or 
storage.  Keep away from children, animals, and unauthorized personnel. 
 
 
PRODUCT STORAGE: 
 
Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated location away from acids, chlorine and chlorine compounds, 
hypochlorite 
(bleach), 
organic 
solvents, 
sulfur 
and 
sulfite 
compounds, 
phosphorus, 
combustible/flammable materials, and direct sunlight.  Keep containers tightly closed when not in use and 
open carefully to prevent spillage.  Storage on wooden floors and pallets is not recommended. Do not 
contaminate water, food or feed by storage or disposal. 
 
SECTION 8:  EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
 
No Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) or American 
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit values (TLV) have been 
established for this product. 
 
Wear splash proof goggles to protect the eyes.  Use gloves and protective clothing to protect against skin 
contact.  Remove contaminated clothing immediately and laundry before reuse. 
 
Use directions for this product typically require its activation by mixing with GRAS (generally regarded as 
safe) acids.  The reaction leads to formation of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas. ClO2 has a PEL of 0.1 
ppm and a STEL of 0.3 ppm. Applications where activated product is used in confined space or has the 
potential for exposure to the worker, such as in a fogging or spraying application, respiratory protection 
is required. 
 
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: 
 
In accordance with OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1910.134 and 29 CFR 1910.1000) use a NIOSH approved air 
purifying respirators (APR) with cartridges approved for chlorine dioxide (ClO2)
