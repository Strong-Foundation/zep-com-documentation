Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Harmful if swallowed. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Suitable extinguishing media 
: Use water spray, alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical or 
carbon dioxide. 
 
Unsuitable extinguishing 
media 
: High volume water jet 
 
 
Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide
