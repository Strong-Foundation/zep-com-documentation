SAFETY DATA SHEET 
 
 
3 
First-aid measures 
general  
:  
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label 
where possible).  
First-aid measures after 
inhalation  
:  
Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. Immediately call a poison 
center or doctor/physician.  
First-aid measures after 
skin contact  
:  
Remove/Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with water/shower. Immediately call a poison 
center or doctor/physician.  
First-aid measures after 
eye contact  
:  
Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue 
rinsing. Immediately call a poison center or doctor/physician.  
First-aid measures after 
ingestion  
:  
Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Immediately call a poison center or doctor/physician.  
 
 
4.2 Most Important Symptoms and Effects, Both Acute and Delayed  
 
Acute: Ingestion will cause burns or irritation to linings of mouth, throat and distress to the gastrointestinal tract.  
May cause severe chemical and mechanical eye damage and irritation with direct contact.  
May cause burns or irritation of skin. 
Will irritate upper respiratory tract and may cause corrosion.  
 
Delayed and Chronic Effects: Expected to be similar to acute exposures. 
 
4.3 Indication of the Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed: Treat symptomatically. Obtain medical assistance

A3 - For combination packaging, if glass inner packaging (including ampoules) are used, they must be packed 
with absorbent material in tightly closed metal receptacles before packing in outer packaging.  
A7 - Steel packaging must be corrosion-resistant or have protection against corrosion.  
B2 - MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 305, and MC 306 and DOT 406 cargo tanks are not authorized. 
B15 - Packaging must be protected with non-metallic linings impervious to the lading or have a suitable 
corrosion allowance. I 
B2 - Authorized IBCs: Metal (31A, 31B and 31N); Rigid plastics (31H1 and 31H2); Composite (31HZ1). 
Additional Requirement: Only liquids with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 110 kPa at 50 C (1.1 bar at 
122 F), or 130 kPa at 55 C (1.3 bar at 131 F) are authorized.  
N6 - Battery fluid packaged with electric storage batteries, wet or dry, must conform to the packaging provisions 
of 173.159 (g) or (h) of this subchapter. 
N34 - Aluminum construction materials are not authorized for any part of a packaging which is normally in 
contact with the hazardous material.  
T8 - 4 178.274(d)(2) Normal............. Prohibited  
TP2 - a. The maximum degree of filling must not exceed the degree of filling determined by the following: 
(image) Where: tr is the maximum mean bulk temperature during transport, tf is the temperature in degrees 
celsius of the liquid during filling, and a is the mean coefficient of cubical expansion of the liquid between the 
mean temperature of the liquid during filling (tf) and the maximum mean bulk temperature during transportation 
(tr) both in degrees celsius. b. For liquids transported under ambient conditions may be calculated using the 
formula: (image) Where: d15 and d50 are the densities (in units of mass per unit volume) of the liquid at 15 C 
(59 F) and 50 C (122 F), respectively.
