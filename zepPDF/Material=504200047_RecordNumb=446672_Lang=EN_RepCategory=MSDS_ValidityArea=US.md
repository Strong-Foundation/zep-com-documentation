Section 5: Fire-Fighting Measures 
Extinguishing Media 
Use dry chemical, carbon dioxide, chemical foam, or water spray 
to extinguish.  
Use water spray to cool containers. 
Specific Hazards 
The vapors are heavier than air and may accumulate in low-lying 
areas. Vapors may travel long distances and ignite at an ignition 
source, which can cause a flashback or an explosion. 
Combustion Products 
Produces carbon oxides (CO, CO2). 
Fire-Fighter 
Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full fire-fighting 
turn-out gear. 
Section 6: Accidental Release Measures 
Personal Protection 
See personal protection recommendations in Section 8. 
Precautions for 
Response 
Avoid breathing the mist/spray/vapors. Remove or keep away all 
sources of extreme heat or open flames. 
Environmental 
Precautions 
Avoid releasing to the environment. Prevent spill from entering 
drains and waterways. 
Containment Methods 
Not applicable  
Cleaning Methods 
Collect liquid in a sealable, solvent-resistant container. Sprinkle 
inert absorbent compound onto spill, then sweep into the 
container. Wash spill area with soap and water to remove the 
last traces of residue.  
Disposal Methods 
Dispose of spill waste according to Section 13.

Personal Protective Equipment 
Eye protection 
Wear appropriate protective eyeglasses or chemical safety 
goggles. 
Recommendation: Ensure that glasses have side shields for 
lateral protection. 
Skin Protection 
For likely contacts, use of protective butyl rubber, fluorinated 
rubber, or other chemically resistant gloves.  
For incidental contacts, neoprene or other chemically resistant 
gloves.  
Respiratory Protection 
For over-exposures up to 10 x OEL of mist/vapors/spray, wear 
respirator such as a half-mask respirator with organic vapor 
cartridges.  
Above 10 x OEL, use a positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator 
or a self-contained breathing apparatus.  
RECOMMENDATION: Consult your local safety supply store to 
ensure your respirator has filter cartridges appropriate for the 
ingredients listed in section 3 of this SDS, and that the 
respirator is fitted to the employee by a professional.  
 
General Hygiene Considerations  
Wash hands thoroughly with water and soap after handling.
