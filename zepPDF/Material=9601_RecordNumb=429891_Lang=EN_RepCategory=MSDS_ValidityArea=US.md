SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
General advice 
: Move out of dangerous area. 
Show this safety data sheet to the doctor in attendance. 
Do not leave the victim unattended. 
Get medical attention immediately. 
 
If inhaled 
: Consult a physician after significant exposure. 
If unconscious, place in recovery position and seek medical 
advice. 
 
In case of skin contact 
: If skin irritation persists, call a physician. 
Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 
minutes. 
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. 
 
If swallowed 
: Keep respiratory tract clear. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms of overexposure may include disorientation; 
dizziness; and confusion.  May progress to unconsciousness, 
paralysis, and convulsions. 
 
Symptoms may include irritation, redness, pain, and rash. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Symptoms may include shortness of breath, dry cough, and 
irritation of the nose, eyes, lips, mouth, and throat. 
Aspiration may cause pulmonary oedema and pneumonitis. 
Causes skin irritation. 
May cause drowsiness or dizziness.

Specific hazards during 
firefighting 
: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses. 
 
 
Hazardous combustion 
products 
:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon monoxide 
Smoke 
Specific extinguishing 
methods 
: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to local 
circumstances and the surrounding environment. 
 
Further information 
: Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains. 
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must 
be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
For safety reasons in case of fire, cans should be stored 
separately in closed containments. 
Use a water spray to cool fully closed containers.

Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Ensure adequate ventilation. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel,

Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Always replace cap after use.
