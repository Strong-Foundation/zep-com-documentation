Description of first aid measures 
· General Information  
Sulfites may cause allergic-type reaction including anaphylactic symptoms or less severe asthmatic episodes in 
certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulphite sensitivity in the general population is unknown 
and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in 
non-asthmatic people. 
· Potential Health effects  
Inhalation: Breathing of vapor or mist is possible if this material is heated or sprayed. Breathing this material 
causes irritation of the throat and lungs with cough and difficult breathing. 
Skin: Causes severe skin irritation with redness, and itching or burning feeling, and/or swelling of the skin. May 
cause skin damage. Note: May cause skin burns and permanent skin damage. 
Eye:  Causes severe eye irritation with tearing, redness, or a stinging or burning feeling. May cause swelling of 
the eyes with blurred vision. Can injure eye tissue. Effects may become more serious with repeated or prolonged 
contact. Note: May cause burns and permanent injury to eye tissue. 
Ingestion:  Swallowing this material may be harmful or cause death. Harmful effects include burns and 
permanent damage to the digestive tract, including the mouth, throat, stomach and intestines. Symptoms may 
include severe abdominal pain and vomiting of blood. Blood loss through damaged tissue can lead to low blood 
pressure and shock 
 
· Signs and Symptoms of exposure: Depending upon level and duration of exposure, other possible signs and 
symptoms 
from breathing, swallowing, and/or entry of this material through the skin may include nosebleeds, hoarseness, 
sore throat, wheezing, cough with phlegm, bronchitis, tightness of the chest, pulmonary edema (high levels) 
irritation of the nose, throat, airways, and lungs with cough and difficult breathing, burns or ulceration of the 
gastrointestinal tract, including stridor, drooling, and vomiting 
 
· After inhalation: 
Remove individual to fresh air and get immediate attention. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If breathing 
stops, give artificial respiration.

Hold the eyelids apart and flush the eye gently with a large amount of water for at least 15 minutes. Get 
immediate medical attention. 
· After swallowing: 
Have person drink a glass of water immediately if able to swallow. Get immediate attention. Do not induce 
vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious 
person.

Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures 
Ensure adequate ventilation 
Wear proactive equipment.  Keep unprotective persons away. 
For large spills, use respiratory protective device against the effects of fumes/dust/aerosol 
· Environmental precautions: Sodium sulphite is non-hazardous solution commonly used as a waste water 
dechlorinating agent. High concentrations will contribute to elevated chemical oxygen demand in aquatic 
environment. Sodium chlorite in contact with acidic soil could generate chlorine dioxide. 
· Methods and material for containment and cleanup 
Leaks or spill may be located by spaying the area with ammonium hydroxide solution which forms a white fume 
in the presence of sulphur dioxide. Dilute with water and mop up or adsorb with an inert dry material and place in 
an appropriate waste disposal container. If necessary, neutralize the residue with a dilute 
solution of acetic acid. 
Large spills should be handled by absorbing with DRY earth, sand or other noncombustible material. Do not 
touch spilled material with bare hands. Use water spray to reduce the chemical. Prevent entry into sewers, 
basement, or confined area; dike if needed. Call for assistance. Neutralize the residue with dilute solution of 
acetic acid. 
· Reference to other sections 
See Section 7 for information on safe handling. 
See Section 8 for information on personal protection equipment. 
See Section 13 for disposal information.

Handling 
· Precautions for safe handling 
Do not get in eyes, or on skin, or clothing. Do not taste or swallow. Avoid breathing mists or fumes. Do not 
handle with bare hands. Remove and wash contaminated clothing. 
Carefully monitor handling, use and storage to avoid spills and leaks. Follow protective controls set forth in 
Section 8 when handling this product. Do not eat, drink, or smoke in work area. Wash hands prior to eating, 
drinking, or using restroom. This solution contains sodium sulfite. It is a strong reducing agent, also, it is strong 
base. Mix only into water. Do not contaminate with garbage, organic matter, 
household products, chemicals, soap products, paint products, solvents, acids, vinegar, beverages, oils, pine oil, 
dirty rags, or any other foreign matter. 
 
· Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities 
· Storage: 
· Requirements to be met by storerooms and receptacles: 
Store in a cool location. Do not store at temperatures above 37 C (100 F). 
Store only in the original receptacle. Do not remove or deface labels or tags. 
Provide ventilation for receptacles. 
Avoid contact with combustible or readily oxidizable and reducible materials.
