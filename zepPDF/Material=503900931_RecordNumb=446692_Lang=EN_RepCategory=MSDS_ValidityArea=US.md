SECTION 5: FIREFIGHTING MEASURES
5.1 Extinguishing media
5.2 Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture
Proprietary items on this SDS are designated as trade secrets. Requests for disclosure of trade secret 
information will be made in accordance with the provisions contained in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200(i).
If victim is conscious and able to swallow, quickly have victim drink water or milk to dilute. 
Do NOT give sodium bicarbonate, fruit juices or vinegar. NEVER give anything by mouth if 
victim is unconscious or having convulsions. Induce vomiting only if advised by physician or 
Poison Control Center. CALL PHYSICIAN OR POISON CONTROL CENTER 
IMMEDIATELY.
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of cool water for at least 15 minutes. Do NOT permit 
victim to rub eyes. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY.
Immediately remove victim to fresh air. If victim has stopped breathing give artificial 
respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY.
Individuals should perform only those firefighting procedures for which they have been trained. Use water spray, dry 
chemical, foam or carbon dioxide. Use water to keep fire-exposed containers cool. If a spill or leak has not ignited, use 
water spray to disperse the vapors. Water spray may be used to flush spills away from fire and diluted spills to 
noncombustible proportions (see warning on water spray on hot glycol below).

Handle in the presence of adequate ventilation. Engineering controls should be used 
whenever feasible to maintain concentrations below acceptable exposure criteria, 
including enclosures and local exhaust ventilation.
Where exposure is likely to exceed acceptable criteria and engineering controls are 
not feasible, use NIOSH/MSHA approved respiratory protection equipment. 
Respirators should be selected based on the form and concentration of contaminants 
in air and in accordance with OSHA (29 CFR 1910.134).
Wear gloves and protective clothing which are impervious to the product for the 
duration of exposure if there is potential for skin contact.
Wear safety glasses meeting the specifications of ANSI Standard Z87.1 where no 
contact with the eye is anticipated. Chemical safety goggles meeting the specification 
of ANSI Standard Z87.1 should be worn whenever there is the possibility of 
splashing or other contact with the eyes.

SECTION 12: ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Diethylene Glycol
 Acute oral LD50's = 12,600 mg/kg (rat)
                                  23,700 mg/kg (mouse)
If pyrolyzed, thermal decomposition products of residue may include C, CO, 
CO2, H2O, NH3, organic vapors and nitrogen-containing.
Breathing excessive levels of the vapor or mist can irritate the respiratory tract.  Excessive vapor 
concentrations of the major component (Ethylene glycol), might be generated during heating of this 
material, have occasionally been reported to cause adverse effects on the blood-forming system and the 
nervous system.
The acute oral toxicities of the main components of this mixture are as follows:
Ethylene glycol:
The lowest dose reported to produce death in humans was estimated to be 1,560 mg/kg body weight;  
for a person weighing 150 pounds, this would be equivalent to drinking about three fluid ounces of pure 
Ethylene glycol in a short period of time.
 Acute oral LD50's = 4,700 mg/kg (rats)
                                  5,500 mg/kg (mouse)
Based on the pH and irritation potential of this mixture’s constituents, the mist or liquid can be 
expected to cause mild to moderate irritation or inflammation of the eyes.
The acute dermal LD50 of the major component (Ethylene glycol) of this product is 
9,530mg/kg (rabbits). Based on the pH and the irritation potential of this mixture’s constituents, the mist 
or liquid can be expected to cause mild to moderate irritation of the skin.
IARC: No component of this product present at levels greater than or equal to 0.1% is identified as probable, possible 
or confirmed human carcinogen by IARC.
NTP: No component of this product present at levels greater than or equal to 0.1% is identified as a known or 
anticipated carcinogen by NTP.
OSHA: No component of this product present at levels greater than or equal to 0.1% is identified as a carcinogen or 
potential carcinogen by OSHA.
