Precautionary Statements 
 
Prevention: 
Do not breathe vapors, mist, or spray. Wash affected area thoroughly after handling. Use only 
outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Contaminated work clothing should not be allowed out of 
the workplace. Wear protective gloves, eye protection, and face protection. [In case of 
inadequate ventilation] wear respiratory protection. 
Response: 
IF ON SKIN: Wash with plenty of water. IF INHALED: Remove victim to fresh air and keep at 
rest in a position comfortable for breathing. Immediately call a POISON CENTER or physician. 
IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present 
and easy to do. Continue rinsing. If skin irritation or rash occurs: Get medical attention. If eye 
irritation persists: Get medical attention. If experiencing respiratory symptoms: Call a poison 
center or physician. Take off contaminated clothing. 
Storage: 
Store in a well-ventilated place. Keep container tightly closed. Store locked up. 
Disposal: 
Dispose of contents and/or container according to Federal, State/Provincial and local 
governmental regulations.  
 
 
Classification complies with OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) and is consistent with the provisions of the

4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Inhalation: 
Move to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If not breathing, give 
artificial respiration. Get medical attention.  
 
Skin contact: 
Immediately flush skin with plenty of water (using soap, if available). Remove 
contaminated clothing and footwear. Get medical attention. Wash clothing 
before reuse. Thoroughly clean shoes before reuse.  
 
Eye contact: 
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Get 
medical attention.  
 
Ingestion: 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Get medical 
attention.  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
Notes to physician: 
Treat symptomatically and supportively. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media: 
Foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.   
 
Special firefighting procedures: 
Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing, such as 
turn-out gear.  
 
Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
In case of fire, keep containers cool with water spray.  Closed containers may 
rupture (due to build up of pressure) when exposed to extreme heat.  
 
Hazardous combustion products: 
Oxides of carbon. Oxides of sulfur. Oxides of barium. Irritating vapors. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and 
unprotected personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Do not allow product to enter sewer or waterways. Wear appropriate 
protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Prevent further leakage or 
spillage if safe to do so. Ventilated area.  
 
Clean-up methods: 
Ensure adequate ventilation. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment. 
Refer to Section 8 "Exposure Controls / Personal Protection" prior to clean up. 
Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, 
universal binder, sawdust). Scrape up spilled material and place in a closed 
container for disposal.

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling: 
Prevent contact with eyes, skin and clothing.  Do not breathe vapor and mist.  
Wash thoroughly after handling. Use only with adequate ventilation. Keep 
container closed.  
 
Storage: 
Keep container tightly closed and in a cool, well-ventilated place away from 
incompatible materials. Keep away from heat, spark and flame. Protect from 
direct sunlight.  
 
8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
 
Employers should complete an assessment of all workplaces to determine the need for, and selection of, proper 
exposure controls and protective equipment for each task performed.
