SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Personal precautions, 
protective equipment and 
emergency procedures 
: Use personal protective equipment. 
Remove all sources of ignition. 
Evacuate personnel to safe areas. 
Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive 
concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for
