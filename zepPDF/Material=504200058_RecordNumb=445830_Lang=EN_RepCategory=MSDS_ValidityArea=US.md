4.1  First Aid Measures  
General Advice
If symptoms persist, call a physician. Take a copy of the Safety Data Sheet when going for
medical treatment.
Eye Contact
Immediately flush with plenty of water.  After initial flushing, remove any contact lenses and
continue flushing for at least 15 minutes. Keep eye wide open while rinsing. If eye irritation
persists, consult a specialist.
Skin Contact
Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water while removing all contaminated
clothes and shoes. If skin irritation persists, call a physician.

Appropriate engineering controls 
Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas. Consider the potential hazards of
this material (see Section 2), applicable exposure limits, job activities, and other substances
in the work place when designing engineering controls and selecting personal protective
equipment.  If engineering controls or work practices are not adequate to prevent exposure
to harmful levels of this material, the personal protective equipment listed below is
recommended.  The user should read and understand all instructions and limitations
supplied with the equipment since protection is usually provided for a limited time or under
certain circumstances.
Personal Protective Equipment 
Eye/face protection
Tightly fitting safety goggles. Wear chemical splash goggles and face shield when eye and
face contact is possible due to splashing or spraying of material.
Skin protection
Impervious clothing. Additional body garments should be used based upon the task being
performed to avoid exposed skin surfaces.  Glove Type:  Neoprene, Nitriles.

12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION
12.1 Ecotoxicity 
Ecotoxicity effects
Harmful to aquatic organisms, may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic
environment. Plants and animals may experience harmful or fatal effects when coated with
petroleum products. Petroleum-based (mineral) lubricating oils normally will float on water.
In stagnant or slow-flowing waterways, an oil layer can cover a large surface area. As a
result, this oil layer might limit or eliminate natural atmospheric oxygen transport into the
water. With time, if not removed, oxygen depletion in the waterway may be sufficient to
cause a fish kill or create an anaerobic environment.
Unknown aquatic toxicity
98.3% of the mixture consists of components(s) of unknown hazards to the aquatic
environment
12.2  Persistence and degradability 
The hydrocarbons in this material are not readily biodegradable, but since they can be
degraded by microorganisms, they are regarded as inherently biodegradable.

13. DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS
Hazard characteristic and regulatory waste stream classification can change with product use. Accordingly, it is the
responsibility of the user to determine the proper storage, transportation, treatment and/or disposal methodologies for
spent materials and residues at the time of disposition.
To minimize exposure, see Section 8 (Exposure Controls/Personal Protection) of the SDS.
Waste Disposal Method
This material, as supplied, is not a hazardous waste according to Federal regulations (40
CFR 261).  This material could become a hazardous waste if it is mixed with or otherwise

the altered material is a hazardous waste.  Consult the appropriate state, regional, or local
regulations for additional requirements.
Contaminated packaging
Empty Container Warning (where applicable): Empty containers may contain residue and
can be dangerous. Do not attempt to refill or clean containers without proper instructions.
Empty drums should be completely drained and safely stored until appropriately
reconditioned or disposed. Empty containers should be taken for recycling, recovery, or
disposal through suitably qualified or licensed contractor and in accordance with
governmental regulations. DO NOT PRESSURISE, CUT, WELD, BRAZE, SOLDER,
DRILL, GRIND, OR EXPOSE SUCH CONTAINERS TO HEAT, FLAME, SPARKS, STATIC
ELECTRICITY, OR OTHER SOURCES OF IGNITION. THEY MAY EXPLODE AND
CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH.
