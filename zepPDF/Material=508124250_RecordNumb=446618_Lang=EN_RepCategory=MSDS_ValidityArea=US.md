4.  FIRST AID MEASURES 
 
Inhalation: 
Move to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If not breathing, give 
artificial respiration. Get medical attention.  
 
Skin contact: 
Immediately flush skin with plenty of water (using soap, if available). Remove 
contaminated clothing and footwear. Wash clothing before reuse. Get medical 
attention.  
 
Eye contact: 
Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 
minutes. Get medical attention.  
 
Ingestion: 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Get medical 
attention.  
 
Symptoms: 
See Section 11. 
 
5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES 
 
Extinguishing media: 
Water spray (fog), foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.   
 
Special firefighting procedures: 
Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing, such as 
turn-out gear. In case of fire, keep containers cool with water spray.  
 
Unusual fire or explosion hazards: 
Uncontrolled polymerization may occur at high temperatures resulting in 
explosions or rupture of storage containers.  
 
Hazardous combustion products: 
Oxides of carbon. Oxides of sulfur. Oxides of nitrogen. Irritating organic 
vapours. 
 
6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
 
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected 
personnel. 
 
Environmental precautions: 
Do not allow product to enter sewer or waterways.  
 
Clean-up methods: 
Remove all sources of ignition. Evacuate and ventilate spill area; dike spill to 
prevent entry into water system; wear full protective equipment during clean-
up. Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, 
universal binder, sawdust). Scrape up as much material as possible. Store in a 
partly filled, closed container until disposal. Refer to Section 8 "Exposure 
Controls / Personal Protection" prior to clean up.

7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Handling: 
Use only with adequate ventilation. Prevent contact with eyes, skin and 
clothing.  Do not breathe vapor and mist.  Wash thoroughly after handling. 
Keep container closed. Refer to Section 8.  
 
Storage: 
For safe storage, store between 0 °C (32°F) and 32 °C (89.6 °F) 
Keep in a cool, well ventilated area away from heat, sparks and open flame. 
Keep container tightly closed until ready for use.  
 
8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION 
 
Employers should complete an assessment of all workplaces to determine the need for, and selection of, proper exposure 
controls and protective equipment for each task performed.
