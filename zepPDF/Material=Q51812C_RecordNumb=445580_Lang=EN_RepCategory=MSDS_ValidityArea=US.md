HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION 
PRODUCTS: 
Thermal breakdown of this product during fire or very high heat conditions may evolve the 
following hazardous decomposition product:  Carbon oxides and traces of incompletely 
burned carbon compounds.  Silicone dioxide.  Formaldehyde.  
SECTION 6 – ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
PERSONAL PRECAUTIONS: 
Observe all personal protective equipment recommendations described in Sections 5 and 8. 
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS: 
Disposal of collected product, residues, and cleanup materials may be 
governmentally regulated.  Observe all applicable local, state and federal waste 
management regulations. 
METHODS FOR CLEANING UP: 
Ventilate area.  Contain spill.   Evacuate unprotected personnel from hazard area.  Wipe up 
or scrape up and contain for salvage or disposal.  Cover with absorbent, place in approved 
drum; Clean area as appropriate since spilled materials, even in small quantities, may 
present a slip hazard.  Dispose of saturated absorbant or cleaning materials appropriately, 
since spontaneous heating may occur.  Local, state, and federal reporting requirements may 
apply to spills or releases of this material into the environment.  See applicable regulatory 
compliance information in Section 15. 
SECTION 7 – HANDLING AND STORAGE 
HANDLING: 
Assure good ventilation.  Product evolves acetic acid when exposed to water or humid air.  
Provide ventilation during use to control acetic acid within exposure guidelines or use 
respiratory protection.  Avoid eye contact.  Avoid skin contact.  Do not take internally.  Avoid 
breathing vapor. 
STORAGE: 
 Use reasonable care and store away from oxidizing materials.  Keep container closed and 
store away from water or moisture. 
SECTION 8 – EXPOSURE CONTROL AND PERSONAL PROTECTION 
ENGINEERING CONTROLS: 
LOCAL EXHAUST: 
Recommended 
GENERAL VENTILATION:  
Recommended 
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT: 
EYE PROTECTION: 
Avoid eye contact.  Use proper protection - safety glasses as a minimum.  
SKIN AND BODY PROTECTION: 
Avoid skin contact.  Protect hands with impervious rubber gloves and wear typical full cover 
clothing.  Gloves must be checked before each use for signs of degradation and penetration 
and for proper functioning.  Use nitrile or butyl rubber gloves. 
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: 
Avoid breathing of vapors.  Wear appropriate, properly fitted NIOSH/MSHA approved 
respirator when the airborne contaminant levels exceed the exposure limits indicated on the 
MSDS.  Follow respirator manufacturer’s directions for respirator use. 
HYGIENE MEASURES (INGESTION): 
Wash hands after handling and before eating. 
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES: 
Avoid eye contact.  Avoid skin contact.  Avoid breathing vapor.  Keep container closed.  Do
