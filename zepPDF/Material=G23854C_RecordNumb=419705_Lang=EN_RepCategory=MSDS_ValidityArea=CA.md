In case of skin contact 
: Immediate medical treatment is necessary as untreated 
wounds from corrosion of the skin heal slowly and with 
difficulty. 
In case of contact, immediately flush eyes or skin with plenty 
of water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated 
clothing and shoes. 
Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. 
 
In case of eye contact 
: Small amounts splashed into eyes can cause irreversible 
tissue damage and blindness. 
In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water 
for at least 15 minutes. 
Continue rinsing eyes during transport to hospital. 
Remove contact lenses. 
Protect unharmed eye. 
Keep eye wide open while rinsing. 
If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist. 
 
If swallowed 
: Give small amounts of water to drink. 
Keep respiratory tract clear. 
DO NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a 
physician or poison control center. 
Do not give milk or alcoholic beverages. 
Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 
If symptoms persist, call a physician. 
Take victim immediately to hospital. 
 
Most important symptoms 
and effects, both acute and 
delayed 
: Effects are immediate and delayed. 
Symptoms may include blistering, irritation, burns, and pain. 
Chronic effects are delayed and symptoms may not be 
observed during an exposure. 
Effects are dependent on exposure (dose, concentration, 
contact time). 
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. 
Suspected of causing cancer. 
Review section 2 of SDS to see all potential hazards. 
 
Notes to physician 
: Treat symptomatically.  Symptoms may be delayed.
