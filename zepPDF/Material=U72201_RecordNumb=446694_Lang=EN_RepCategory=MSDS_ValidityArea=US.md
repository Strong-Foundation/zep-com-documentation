8.2. Exposure controls
Engineering Controls
Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas. Showers. Eyewash stations. Remove all sources of
ignition.
Personal protective equipment
Eye/face protection
Sufficient eye protection must be worn.
Wear glasses with side protection.
Hand Protection
Use protective gloves. The glove material must be sufficiently impermeable and
resistant to the substance. Check the tightness before wear. Gloves should be well
cleaned before being removed, then stored in a well ventilated location. Pay
attention to skin care.
Skin protection cremes do not protect sufficiently against the substance.
Textile or leather gloves are completely unsuitable.
The following information is valid for aqueous, saturated solutions of the salt.
The following materials are suitable for protective gloves (Permeation time >= 8
hours):
Natural rubber/Natural latex - NR (0.5 mm) (use non-powdered and allergen free
products)
Polychloroprene - CR (0.5 mm)
Nitrile rubber/Nitrile latex - NBR (0.35 mm)
Butyl rubber - Butyl (0.5 mm)
Fluoro carbon rubber - FKM (0.4 mm)
Polyvinyl chloride - PVC (0.5 mm)
Skin and body protection
Depending on the risk, wear a tight protective clothing or a suitable chemical
protection suit.
