concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. 
 
Environmental precautions 
: Prevent product from entering drains. 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. 
If the product contaminates rivers and lakes or drains, inform 
respective authorities. 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up 
: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to 
local / national regulations (see section 13). 
 
 
 
SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 
 
Advice on safe handling 
: Avoid formation of aerosol.

Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
For personal protection see section 8. 
Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the 
application area. 
Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 
Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. 
Open drum carefully as content may be under pressure. 
Dispose of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations. 
Persons susceptible to skin sensitisation problems or asthma, 
allergies, chronic or recurrent respiratory disease should not 
be employed in any process in which this mixture is being 
used. 
 
Conditions for safe storage 
: No smoking. 
Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated 
place. 
Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and 
kept upright to prevent leakage. 
Observe label precautions.
