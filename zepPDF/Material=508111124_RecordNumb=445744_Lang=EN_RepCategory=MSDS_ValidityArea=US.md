5.3 
Advice for Firefighters: 
 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
Use jets of water to cool the containers to prevent product decomposition and the development of 
substances potentially hazardous for health. Always wear full fire prevention gear. Collect extinguishing 
water to prevent it from draining into the sewer system. Dispose of contaminated water used for extinction 
and the remains of the fire according to applicable regulations. 
SPECIAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR FIRE-FIGHTERS 
Normal firefighting clothing i.e.  Fire kit (BS EN 469), gloves (BS EN 659) and boots (HO specification A29 
and A30) in combination with self-contained open circuit positive pressure compressed air breathing 
apparatus (BS EN 137). 
 
 
SECTION 6: 
ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 
6.1 
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures: 
 
Block the leakage if there is no hazard. 
Wear suitable protective equipment (including personal protective equipment referred to under Section 8 of 
the safety data sheet) to prevent any contamination of skin, eyes and personal clothing. These indications 
apply for both processing staff and those involved in emergency procedures. 
6.2 
Environmental Precautions: 
 
The product must not penetrate into the sewer system or come into contact with surface water or ground 
water. 
6.3 
Methods and Material for Containment and Cleaning-Up: 
 
Collect the leaked product into a suitable container. Evaluate the compatibility of the container to be used, 
by checking section 10. 
Absorb the remainder with inert absorbent material. 
Make sure the leakage site is well aired.  Check incompatibility for container material in section 7. 
Contaminated material should be disposed of in compliance with the provisions set forth in point 13.

ventilation, vapours may accumulate at ground level and, if ignited, catch fire even at a distance, with the 
danger of backfire. Avoid bunching of electrostatic charges. 
Do not eat, drink or smoke during use. Remove any contaminated clothes and personal protective 
equipment before entering places in which people eat. Avoid leakage of the product into the environment. 
7.2 
Conditions for Safe Storage, Including and Incompatibilities: 
 
Store only in the original container. Store in a cool and well ventilated place, keep far away from sources of 
heat, naked flames and sparks and other sources of ignition. Keep containers away from any incompatible

8.2 
Exposure Controls: 
 
As the use of adequate technical equipment must always take priority over personal protective equipment, 
make sure that the workplace is well aired through effective local aspiration. 
When choosing personal protective equipment, ask your chemical substance supplier for advice  
Personal protective equipment must be CE marked, showing that it complies with applicable standards. 
HAND PROTECTION 
Protect hands with category III work gloves (see standard EN 374) 
The following should be considered when choosing work glove material, compatibility, degradation, failure 
time and permeability. 
The work gloves’ resistance to chemical agents should be checked before use, as it can be unpredictable. 
The gloves’ wear time depends on the duration and type of use. 
SKIN PROTECTION 
Wear category I professional long-sleeved overalls and safety footwear (see Directive 89/686/EEC and 
standard ISO 20344). Wash body with soap and water after removing protective clothing. 
EYE PROTECTION 
Wear airtight protective goggles (see standard EN 166). 
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION 
If the threshold value (e.g TLV-TWA) is exceeded for the substance or one of the substances present in the 
product, use a mask with a type B filter whose class (1, 2 or 3) must be chosen according to the limit of use 
concentration (see standard EN 14387). In the presence of gases or vapours of various kinds and/or gases 
or vapours containing particulate (aerosol sprays, fumes, mists etc.) combined filters are required. 
Respiratory protection devices must be used if the technical measures adopted are not suitable for 
restricting the worker’s exposure to the threshold values considered. The protection provided by masks is in 
any case limited. 
If the substance considered is odourless or its olfactory threshold is higher than the corresponding TLV-TWA 
and in the case of an emergency, wear open-circuit compressed air breathing apparatus (in compliance with 
standard EN 137) or external air-intake breathing apparatus (in compliance with standard EN 138). For a 
correct choice of respiratory protection device, see standard EN 529. 
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE CONTROLS. 
The emissions generated by manufacturing processes, including those generated by ventilation equipment, 
should be checked to ensure compliance with environmental standards. 
Product residues must not be indiscriminately disposed of with waste water or by dumping in waterways.
